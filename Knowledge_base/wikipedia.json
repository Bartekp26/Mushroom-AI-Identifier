  "Agaricus augustus": {
    "Introduction": "Agaricus augustus, known commonly as the prince, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Agaricus. It is generally edible, but bioaccumulates the metal cadmium.",
    "Taxonomy": "According to Heinemann's (1978) popular division of Agaricus, A. augustus belongs to section Arvenses. The system proposed by Wasser (2002) classifies A. augustus within subgenus Flavoagaricus, section Majores, subsection Flavescentes. Moreover, there have been attempts to recognise distinct varieties, namely A. augustus var. augustus Fr., and A. augustus var. perrarus (Schulzer) Bon & Cappelli.\nThe specific epithet augustus is a Latin adjective meaning noble.",
    "Description": "Agaricus augustus forms large and distinctive agarics. The cap shape is hemispherical during the so-called button stage, and then expands, becoming convex and finally flat, with a diameter from 8–30 cm (3–12 in). The cap cuticle is dry, and densely covered with concentrically arranged, brown-coloured scales on a white to yellow background.\nThe flesh is thick, firm and white and may discolour yellow when bruised. The gills are crowded and pallid at first, and turn pink then dark brown with maturity. The gills are not attached to the stem; they are free. Immature specimens bear a delicate white partial veil with darker-coloured warts, extending from the stem to the cap periphery.\nThe stem is clavate and 7–30 cm (3–12 in) tall, and 2–6 cm (3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in) thick. In mature specimens, the partial veil is torn and left behind as a pendulous ring adorning the stem. Above the ring, the stem is white to yellow and smooth. Below, it is covered with numerous small scales. Its flesh is thick, white and sometimes has a narrow central hollow. The stem base extends deeply into the substrate.\nThe mushroom's odour is strong and sweet, similar to almond extract,  marzipan or maraschino cherry, due to the presence of benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol. Its taste has been described as not distinctive. It shows a red positive Schaeffer's test reaction. The cap cuticle turns yellow when a 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is applied.\n\nUnder a microscope, the ellipsoid-shaped spores are seen characteristically large at 7–10 by 4.5–6.5 μm. The basidia are 4-spored. The spore mass is coloured chocolate-brown.",
    "Similar species": "Toxic lookalikes include Amanitas which stain yellow when bruised or emit bad odor. Another similar-looking toxic species is Agaricus moelleri. Several other members of the genus are similar. Initially reported from North America, A. subrufescens produces smaller spores, sized 6–7.5 by 4–5 μm.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Agaricus augustus has a widespread distribution, occurring throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia, and North America. The mushroom is found in deciduous and coniferous woods and in gardens and by roadside verges. The fungus is saprotrophic and terrestrial; it acquires nutrients from decaying dead organic matter and its fruiting bodies occur on humus-rich soil. The species seems adapted to thriving near human activity, as it also emerges from disturbed ground. In Europe, the species fruits in late summer and autumn. In North America, it is found from April to December.",
    "Potential toxicity": "A. augustus has been implicated in bioaccumulating the metal cadmium, with a quantity of 2.44 mg per kilogram of fresh weight as recorded in one Swiss study. The same phenomenon is true for other edible species of Agaricus, namely A. arvensis, A. macrosporus and A. silvicola, though quantities may vary greatly depending on species, which part of the fruiting body is analysed, and the level of contamination of the substrate. Specimens collected near metal smelters and urban areas have a higher cadmium content. The hymenium contains the highest concentration of metal, followed by the rest of the cap, while the lower part of the stem contains the least.",
    "Uses": "This mushroom is a choice edible for most people. It is collected widely for consumption in Eurasia, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Mexico."

  "Agaricus xanthodermus": {
    "Introduction": "Agaricus xanthodermus, commonly known as the yellow-staining agaricus, yellow-staining mushroom or yellow-stainer, is a species of fungus in the genus Agaricus. It displays a strong yellow colouration at the base of the stem when cut. It has a phenolic smell. It is poisonous for most people, causing gastric upset, but can be eaten by some without apparent negative effect.",
    "Taxonomy": "This species was first officially defined under the name Agaricus xanthodermus in 1876 by Léon Gaston Genevier, in a letter published in the bulletin of the French Botanical Society.  Genevier described the Agaricus mushrooms commonly eaten (perhaps sometimes inadvisedly) in the region of Nantes, and attempted to clarify the distinctions between them. He proposed a detailed reclassification into 5 species, including this new one. Apparently up until that time, these yellow-staining mushrooms were considered to be just varieties of other edible species: A. edulis, A. arvensis, and A. silvicola.\nThe epithet xanthodermus is derived from the Ancient Greek words for \"yellow\" and \"skin\", which were then given a Latin adjective ending. This is the official name, but the form Agaricus xanthoderma is also often seen.  In the latter name, -derma \"skin\" is a neuter noun which does not have to agree in gender with Agaricus, and so this form is legal according to the rules of botanical nomenclature.",
    "Description": "The cap ranges from 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in diameter. It is initially convex, with some young specimens having a squarish shape, though flattening with age. It is whitish, with light brown tints towards the centre. The cap is dry and smooth, but can be scaly when old. The gills of this mushroom progress from pale-pink to a chocolate color. Its white stipe measures 5–12 cm (2.0–4.7 in) tall and 1–3 wide, and is bulbous with a skirt-like ring. Microscopically, the cheilocystidia are club-shaped. The spores are brown, elliptical, and smooth, measuring 6–7 × 3–4 μm.\nThe species has an unpleasant characteristic smell, which is phenolic, reminiscent of ink or carbolic soap. The smell is especially strong at the base of the stem. On cooking, the smell becomes very noticeable, and this may deter people from eating it inadvertently.",
    "Similar species": "The main identifying feature is an immediate bright yellow colouration on cutting through the base of the stem, or scraping the flesh; later, the affected area fades to a dull brown. Numerous edible Agaricus species, such as A. augustus, A. arvensis and A. silvicola, turn yellow to a greater or lesser extent, but they do not display such an intense reaction.\nAgaricus xanthodermus belongs to a group of related species  (the \"Xanthodermati\") which likewise discolour bright yellow and have a phenolic smell. They include A. praeclaresquamosus (formerly A. placomyces) which has dark grey scales, A. moelleri, and A. pilatianus, which does not have a bulbous stem.\nAgaricus californicus is also similar in appearance.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "This mushroom is very common and widely distributed in North America, Europe, West Asia including eastern Anatolia and Iran, North Africa, and southern Africa.  It has been introduced into Australia. It occurs in woods, lawns, gardens and hedgerows in autumn. This is a saprobic species.",
    "Toxicity": "Although it appears that some people can eat this mushroom without ill effects, it contains toxins which can cause serious gastrointestinal upset. It is indigestible and gives rise to symptoms of sweating, flushing, and severe stomach cramps. It is considered poisonous and specifically prohibited for sale in Italy.\nOf those who gather Agaricus-style mushrooms, about 50% of the cases of poisoning are from this species."

  "Amanita augusta": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita augusta, commonly known as the western yellow-veil or western yellow-veiled amanita, is a small tannish-brown mushroom with cap colors bright yellow to dark brown and various combinations of the two colors. The mushroom is often recognizable by the fragmented yellow remnants of the universal veil. This mushroom grows year-round in the Pacific Northwest but fruiting tends to occur in late fall to mid-winter. The fungus grows in an ectomycorrhizal relationship with hardwoods and conifers often in mixed woodlands.",
    "Taxonomy": "A. augusta is a species of agaric fungus in the family Amanitaceae. Found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, it was initially referred to as Amanita franchetti (Boudier 1881) and later Amanita aspera (Thiers 1982, Arora 1986), but suspected of being a distinct species, It was formally described as Amanita augusta in 2013.",
    "Description": "The cap of A. augusta ranges from 4–12 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4+1⁄2 inches) across with a plano-convex curve. The surface of the cap is smooth and ranges in various shades of brown. The surface also contains scattered yellow to brown colored warts formed from the remains of the universal veil. The flesh of the mushroom is soft and tends to be white to light yellow. The lamellae consists of close, white gills that are free or mildly attached to the upper stipe. The stipe ranges from 5–15 cm long and 1–2 cm thick. Most stipe contain a partial veil that resembles a secondary, smaller ring the same color as the cap. The surface of the stipe is white and scattered with occasional scales. Yellow to gray warts remnants of the universal veil on the basal bulb. The spores are elliptical, ranging from 8x12 - 6x8  μm and amyloid. Clamps are not present at the base of basidia. Like many other mushrooms of the Amanita genus, A. augusta contains a white spore print.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Amanita augusta is mycorrhizal with a range of trees in mixed woodlands. Usually found in small groups or alone. This mushroom is most commonly found in Northern and Central California. The fungus is also found along the Pacific Northwest and has been seen in Montana and Idaho.",
    "Ecology": "This species forms ectomycorrhizal associations with conifers and a variety of other hardwoods such as oak, spruce, and Pinus species. This species showed a poor survival rate and is a very slow re-colonizer post controlled burn of host trees. When the fungi reappear and grow mycorrhizae, they form small communities rather than grow in a large group. Two of the most established hosts of A. augusta are P. muricata  and Ps. menziesii.",
    "Toxicity": "Amanita augusta is classified as a non-edible fungus. This mushroom is known to be an accumulator of heavy metals such as zinc, copper, lead, and others found in soil. The metals are mostly found in the cap and accumulate in the sporocarps but the stipe also contains the heavy metals. Many of the wild A. augusta contain levels of heavy metals above the threshold for safe human consumption. This mushroom's ability to accumulate heavy metals more effectively than others is most likely attributed to the ectomycorrhizal associations which allow them to be more efficient in the uptake of metals. One of the most common metals found in this mushroom is zinc.",
    "Uses": "Amanita augusta was found to have strong anti-proliferative activity and could be a potential source for drug discovery. Toxicity testing would need to be done within the mushroom in order to ensure that the medicinal properties are not negated by harmful side effects. Along with being a strong anti-proliferative, this species is also shown to be anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory as well, meaning there may be many possible opportunities for drugs."

  "Amanita brunnescens": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita brunnescens, also known as the brown American star-footed amanita or cleft-footed amanita is a native North American mushroom of the large genus Amanita. It differs from A. phalloides (the death cap) by its fragile volva and tendency to bruise brown.",
    "Taxonomy": "Originally presumed to be the highly toxic Amanita phalloides (the death cap) by renowned American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, it was described and named by George F. Atkinson of Cornell University. He named it after the fact that it bruised brown.",
    "Description": "Amanita brunnescens has a mostly brown cap, with possible tones of olive, grey, or red. At maturity the cap is often around 8–9 centimetres (3+1⁄4–3+1⁄2 inches) wide. The cap margins lack universal veil remnants. The shape of the cap can be bell-shaped to convex, becoming planar as it matures. The flesh within the cap is mostly white or cream and can bruise brown. The characteristic Amanita gills are free from the stipe and white. The stipe is also white, with a smooth basal bulb that distinctly splits into a \"cleft-foot\". It stains reddish-brown on the lower half, especially when handled, and averages about 9 cm tall. A partial veil is present, often white with possible brown coloration. There is no volva, but there may be volval remnants if the fruiting body is excavated carefully, that are white to brownish.\nThe odor, if present, is of raw potatoes. a piece of the stipe may need to be cut in order to detect the faint scent.\nThe spore print is white, and \"the spores measure (7.0-) 8.0–9.2 (-9.5) × (6.5-) 7.2–8.5 (-9.2) μm and are globose to subglobose (occasionally broadly ellipsoid) and amyloid. Clamps are absent from bases of basidia.\"",
    "Variations": "Amanita brunnescens var. pallida is almost identical to the description above, but with a white cap color.",
    "Similar species": "A. brunnescens' most distinguishing features are the characteristic Amanita stature with warts and partial veil, as well as the cleft foot and reddening base.\nSuccessful mushroom identification relies on the collection of mature, healthy and undamaged specimens. Amanitas can be separated from other agarics by their (usually) tall and slender stature, presence of universal veil remnants and/or a volva, and sometimes a partial veil. Other genera with volvas include Volvariella and Volvopluteus which will never have a partial veil or universal veil remnants on the cap. Those genera also have pink spore prints instead of Amanita's white.\nSection Validae, to which A. brunnescens belongs, can be distinguished from other Amanita sections via the smooth bulbous base without a volva, stipe with a partial veil, and no veil remnants hanging off of cap margin. Other Amanita sections have either a conspicuous volva or a concentric/scaly stipe base.\nAmanita amerirubescens has an indistinct (sometimes a little swollen) stipe base, a brassy yellow to reddish cap, and when young, yellowish warts on cap. This species also reddens.\nAmanita flavorubens is similar to A. amerirubescens, but has a yellower cap and warts that retain their yellow color for longer.\nAmanita asteropus is the European version of A. brunnescens.",
    "Toxicity": "It is of unknown edibility and may be poisonous."

  "Amanita calyptroderma": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita calyptroderma also known as coccora, coccoli or the Pacific amanita, is a white-spored mushroom that fruits naturally in the Sierra Nevada and coastal forests of the western United States during the fall, winter and spring.",
    "Description": "This mushroom's cap is about 10–25 centimetres (4–10 inches) in diameter, usually orange-brown in color (but sometimes white), and partially covered by a thick white patch of universal veil. It has white, close gills. Its cream-colored stalk is about 10–20 cm in length and 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) in width, adorned with a partial veil. It has a partially hollow stem (filled with a stringy white pith), and a large, sacklike volva at the base of the stalk.\nThe spores of this species, which are white, do not change color when placed in a solution of Melzer's reagent, and thus are termed inamyloid. This characteristic in combination with the skirt-like annulus and absence of a bulb at the base of the stalk place this mushroom in the section Caesareae.",
    "Similar species": "The deadly poisonous A. phalloides is similar in appearance.\nAmanita vernicoccora is a closely related edible species, which fruits in hilly or mountainous areas from late winter to spring. Otherwise similar in appearance, its cap is yellow. A. caesarea is also related and edible.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "This mushroom occurs in conifer forests, forming mycorrhizae with madrone (Arbutus menziesii) in the southern part of its range (Central California northwards to Washington).  However, in the northern part of its range (Washington to southern Canada), its preferred host is Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).",
    "Edibility": "Experienced mushroom hunters regard this mushroom as a good edible species, but caution must be exercised when collecting A. calyptroderma for the table, since it can be confused with other species in the genus. Amanita contains some of the deadliest mushrooms in the world, most notably A. phalloides and A. ocreata."
  },
  "Amanita citrina": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita citrina (synonym Amanita mappa), commonly known as the false death cap or citron amanita, is a basidiomycotic mushroom. It grows in silicate soil in the summer and autumn months. It bears a pale yellow or sometimes white cap, with white stem, ring and volva. It is an inedible mushroom due to its toxicity, but is more pertinently often confused for the lethal death cap.",
    "Description": "This mushroom has a fleshy pale yellow, or sometimes white, cap from 4–10 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4 inches) across, covered in irregular patches. The gills and flesh are white. There is a large volva at the base of the 6–8 cm (2+1⁄2–3 in) tall stem, which has a clear ring.\nThe mushroom has a smell of rapeseed or potato.",
    "Similar species": "It is often confused with the related Amanita phalloides, the death cap, hence the common name.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The false death cap is found in deciduous and coniferous woodlands in autumn in Europe. It is also found in North American oak and pine forests.",
    "Toxicity": "This mushroom contains the alpha-amanitin toxin, but possibly in small enough amounts that would not cause adverse effects unless ingested at high quantity. It also contains the toxin bufotenin. Although it is considered inedible, the biggest danger with this species is its marked similarity to the death cap. For further more information about DMT found in Amanita citrina see external link about the study made."

  "Amanita flavoconia": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita flavoconia, commonly known as yellow patches, yellow wart, orange amanita, yellow-dust amanita or the American yellow dust amanita, is a species of mushroom in the family Amanitaceae. It has an orangish-yellow cap with yellowish-orange patches or warts, a yellowish-orange annulus, and a white to orange stem. Common and widespread throughout eastern North America, it grows on the ground in broad-leaved and mixed forests, especially in mycorrhizal association with hemlock.",
    "Taxonomy": "Amanita flavoconia was first described by American naturalist George Francis Atkinson in 1902, based on a specimen he found in woods north of Fall Creek, Cayuga Lake Basin, New York State. Jean-Edouard Gilbert placed it in Amplariella, in 1941, while in 1948 William Alphonso Murrill thought that it belonged best in Venenarius; both of these segregate genera have been folded back into Amanita.\nThe specific epithet flavoconia means yellowish and conical. Its common names include \"yellow patches\", \"yellow wart\", \"orange Amanita\", or \"yellow-dust Amanita\".",
    "Description": "The cap is initially ovoid in shape, but in maturity becomes convex and eventually flattened. Orange to bright yellow-orange in color, it reaches diameters of 3 to 9 centimetres (1 to 3+1⁄2 inches). Young specimens are covered with chrome yellow warts that may be easily rubbed off or washed away with rain.\nThe cap surface is smooth and sticky (viscid) beneath the warts; the edge of the cap is striate, reflecting the arrangement of the gills underneath. The flesh is white. The gills are barely free from the stem, and packed close together. They are white or tinged yellow on the edges, and initially covered with a yellowish partial veil. The stem is typically 5.5 to 11.5 cm (2 to 4+1⁄2 in) long by 0.7 to 1.4 cm (1⁄4 to 1⁄2 in) thick, equal or slightly tapered upward from a small rounded bulb at the base. Its color may range from white to yellowish orange, and the surface may be smooth, or covered with small flakes. The base of the stem usually has chrome yellow flakes of universal veil material adhering loosely to the bulb, or in the soil around the base. The partial veil leaves a skirt-like ring, (annulus) on the upper stem. The spore print is white.\nCampbell and Petersen published a detailed description of the characteristics of A. flavoconia grown in culture. In the era prior to the commonplace use of DNA analysis and phylogenetics, cultural characters were often used to help provide additional taxonomic information; they found considerable variability between different isolates.\nTwo variants have been reported from Colombia, collected from Quercus humboldtii forests: A. flavoconia var. sinapicolor and var. inquinata.",
    "Microscopic features": "The spores are elliptical, smooth, and have dimensions of 7–9 by 5–8 μm. They are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid, meaning that they absorb the iodine stain in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are up to 35–43 μm long by 4–12 μm, and each have four sterigmata, extensions that hold the spores. The outer layer, or cuticle of the cap (known technically as the pileipellis) is made of filamentous interwoven gelatinized hyphae, with diameters between 3 and 7 μm.",
    "Similar species": "This species has often been confused with A. muscaria, some subspecies of which are also orange-colored. It also bears some resemblance to A. frostiana and A. flavorubescens. One 1982 study concluded that a \"large majority\" of herbarium specimens labeled as A. frostiana were actually A. flavoconia. The use of microscopic features is necessary to distinguish clearly among the species: A. flavoconia has elliptic, amyloid spores, while A. frostiana has round, non-amyloid spores; A. muscaria has nonamyloid, elliptic spores. In the field, A. flavorubescens can usually be distinguished by its yellow cap color.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "A common mycorrhizal mushroom, A. flavoconia grows solitarily or in groups on the ground in the summer to the fall, in broad-leaved and mixed woods. Noted for preferring hemlock, it is also associated with high elevation red spruce forests.\nIn North America, A. flavoconia has a wide distribution and has been collected from several locations, including Ontario, Canada; the United States (Iowa), and Mexico. It has been described as \"of the most common and widespread species of Amanita in eastern North America.\"",
    "Edibility": "As the edibility of this species is unknown, it should not be consumed, and a number of its relatives are quite poisonous."
  },
  "Amanita muscaria": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Amanita. Its common name derives from its traditional use as an insecticide. It is a distinctive, large white-gilled mushroom typically featuring a bright red cap covered with white warts. The complex genetic diversity of A. muscaria suggests that it is a species complex. It is a widely distributed mushroom native to temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere, now also naturalised in the Southern Hemisphere, forming symbiotic relationships with various trees and spreading invasively in some regions.\nIngestion of the mushroom can cause poisoning, especially in children and those seeking its hallucinogenic effects, due to psychoactive compounds like muscimol and the ibotenic acid; however, fatal poisonings are extremely rare. Parboiling reduces toxicity, though drying converts ibotenic acid into muscimol, retaining psychoactive effects. Some cultures use it as food after preparation. Indigenous peoples of Siberia used A. muscaria as an inebriant and entheogen. It has been controversially linked to Santa Claus, Viking berserkers, Vedic soma, and early Christianity, though evidence is sparse and disputed. Its rise in the 2020s as a legal hallucinogen alternative has led to Food and Drug Administration scrutiny.\nA. muscaria has appeared in art and literature since the Renaissance, becoming iconic in fairy tales, children’s books, and media like Disney’s Fantasia (1940) and the Super Mario video games. It has also influenced literary depictions of altered perception—most notably in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland—and has been referenced in novels by writers including Oliver Goldsmith, Thomas Pynchon, and Alan Garner.",
    "Taxonomy": "The name of the mushroom in many European languages is thought to derive from its use as an insecticide when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from Germanic-  and Slavic-speaking parts of Europe, as well as the Vosges region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania. Albertus Magnus was the first to record it in his work De vegetabilibus some time before 1256, commenting, \"it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies\".\nThe 16th-century Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to Frankfurt in Germany, while Carl Linnaeus, the \"father of taxonomy\", reported it from Småland in southern Sweden, where he had lived as a child. He described it in volume two of his Species Plantarum in 1753, giving it the name Agaricus muscarius, the specific epithet deriving from Latin musca meaning \"fly\". It gained its current name in 1783, when placed in the genus Amanita by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a name sanctioned in 1821 by the \"father of mycology\", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries's work, and so the full name was then Amanita muscaria (L.:Fr.) Hook. The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work. Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of Amanita muscaria (L.) Lam..\nThe English mycologist John Ramsbottom reported that Amanita muscaria was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and bug agaric was an old alternative name for the species. French mycologist Pierre Bulliard reported having tried without success to replicate its fly-killing properties in his work Histoire des plantes vénéneuses et suspectes de la France (1784), and proposed a new binomial name Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus because of this. One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein (1,3-di(cis-9-octadecenoyl)glycerol), which attracts insects.\nIt has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties.\nAn alternative derivation proposes that the term fly- refers not to insects as such but rather the delirium resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness. Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the \"mad\" or \"fool's\" version of the highly regarded edible mushroom Amanita caesarea. Hence there is oriol foll \"mad oriol\" in Catalan, mujolo folo from Toulouse, concourlo fouolo from the Aveyron department in Southern France, ovolo matto from Trentino in Italy. A local dialect name in Fribourg in Switzerland is tsapi de diablhou, which translates as \"Devil's hat\".",
    "Classification": "Amanita muscaria is the type species of the genus. By extension, it is also the type species of Amanita subgenus Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species with patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings, and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A. muscaria and its close relatives, including A. pantherina (the panther cap), A. gemmata, A. farinosa, and A. xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified A. muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.",
    "Subdivision": "Amanita muscaria varies considerably in its morphology and many authorities recognise several subspecies or varieties within the species. In 1986, German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three subspecies (without description): A. muscaria ssp. muscaria, A. muscaria ssp. americana, and A. muscaria ssp. flavivolvata.\nA 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of A. muscaria by mycologist József Geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within the species, roughly representing Eurasian, Eurasian \"subalpine\", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. alba, var. flavivolvata, var. formosa (including var. guessowii), and var. regalis from both areas. All four were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that the forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies or varieties. Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak–hickory–pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on Santa Cruz Island, California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species. Thus A. muscaria as it stands currently is, evidently, a species complex. The complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species: A. breckonii is a buff-capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest, and the brown-capped A. gioiosa and A. heterochroma from the Mediterranean Basin and from Sardinia respectively. Both of these last two are found with Eucalyptus and Cistus trees, and it is unclear whether they are native or introduced from Australia.",
    "Description": "A large, conspicuous mushroom, A. muscaria is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development.\nFly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage reveals a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil, which helps identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from globose to hemispherical and finally to plate-like in mature specimens. The bright red cap ranges from 5–30 centimetres (2–12 inches) in diameter. Age and rain may cause the red colour to fade and the warts to fall off.\nThe free gills are white, as is the spore print. The oval spores measure 9–13 by 6.5–9 μm; they do not turn blue with the application of iodine. The stipe is white, 5–20 cm (2–8 in) high by 1–2 cm (1⁄2–1 in) wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms. At the base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs. Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the partial veil (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white ring. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.",
    "Similar species": "Although very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible A. basii—a Mexican species similar to A. caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A. caesarea-like species in Mexico. A. caesarea is distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap, which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric (though these sometimes wash away during heavy rain). Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native A. xanthocephala (vermilion grisette), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A. muscaria and bears no ring. Additionally, immature button forms resemble puffballs. A. muscaria is also morphologically similar to closely related species in A. stirps Muscaria, including  A. persicina, and  A. chrysoblema.",
    "Varieties": "Amanitaceae.org lists four varieties as of May 2019, but says that they will be segregated into their own taxa \"in the near future\". They are:",
    "Distribution and habitat": "A. muscaria is a cosmopolitan mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. In North America, it is native to parts of Alaska, and occurs alongside imported European trees near the West Coast. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the Siberian–Beringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America. The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to Boletus edulis, and may appear in fairy rings. Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, where it can be found in the Brazilian states of Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.\nEctomycorrhizal, A. muscaria forms symbiotic relationships with many trees, including pine, oak, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, A. muscaria is the fungal equivalent of a weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under silver birch (Betula pendula) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal. Commonly found throughout the great Southern region of western Australia, it is regularly found growing on Pinus radiata.",
    "Toxicity": "A. muscaria poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience, or who confused it with an edible species.\nA. muscaria contains several biologically active agents, at least one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with a small amount likely converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6 mg muscimol or 30 to 60 mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of A. muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings. A. muscaria, unlike some other mushrooms that belong to the Amanita genus, do not contain the highly toxic cyclic peptide α-Amanitin.\nDeaths from A. muscaria have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports, but with modern medical treatment, fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare. Many books list A. muscaria as deadly, but according to David Arora, this is an error that implies the mushroom is far more toxic than it is. Furthermore, the North American Mycological Association has stated that there were \"no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years\".\nThe active constituents of A. muscaria are water-soluble; boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies it. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible. Patrick Harding describes the Sami custom of processing the fly agaric through reindeer.",
    "Pharmacology": "Muscarine\n\nMuscarine, discovered in 1869, was long thought to be the active hallucinogenic agent in A. muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in A. muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi such as Inosperma erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of muscarine in A. muscaria is too low to play a role in the symptoms of poisoning.\n\n\nMuscimol and ibotenic acid\n\nThe major toxins involved in A. muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) and the related amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol is the product of the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A. muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.\nIbotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA receptor agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication.\n\n\nMuscazone\n\nMuscazone is another compound that has more recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It is a product of the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultraviolet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.",
    "Symptoms": "Fly agarics are best known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from mild nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium (like with tetanus.)\nIn cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days. In the majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24 hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.",
    "Treatment": "Medical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given. Gastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion. Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situation.\nThere is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication. Though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.",
    "Psychoactive": "The wide range of psychoactive effects have been variously described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, or deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur; the latter two effects may occur either simultaneously or alternatingly, as part of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, collectively known as dysmetropsia, along with related distortions pelopsia and teleopsia. Some users report lucid dreaming under the influence of its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A. muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A. muscaria began increasing.\nMarija Gimbutas reported to R. Gordon Wasson that in remote areas of Lithuania, A. muscaria has been consumed at wedding feasts, in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka. She also reported that the Lithuanians used to export A. muscaria to the Sami in the Far North for use in shamanic rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in Eastern Europe.\n\n\nSiberia\n\nA. muscaria was widely used as an entheogen by many of the indigenous peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A. muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A. muscaria was not practised by these peoples. In western Siberia, the use of A. muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A. muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously. In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine. This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A. muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.\nThe Koryak of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin (\"Existence\") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms. It was reported that the local reindeer would often follow an individual intoxicated by the muscimol mushroom, and if said individual were to urinate in snow the reindeer would become similarly intoxicated and the Koryak people's would use the drunken state of the reindeer to more easily rope and hunt them.\n\n\nRecent rise in popularity\n\nAs a result of a lack of regulation, the use of A. muscaria as a popular legal alternative to hallucinogens has grown significantly in recent years. In 2024, Google searches for Amanita muscaria rose nearly 200% from the previous year, a trend that an article published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine correlated with the sudden commercialisation of A. muscaria products on the internet.\nWhile Amanita mushrooms are unscheduled in the U.S., they are listed as a poison by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Amanita mushrooms and muscimol are not approved as an ingredient in food, with some drawing comparisons to the controversial legal status of hemp-derived cannabinoids. The FDA is currently evaluating the use of A. muscaria and its constituents in dietary supplements, reminding manufacturers to ensure their ingredients meet safety standards and encouraging them to consult the Office of Dietary Supplement Programs with any questions.\nA recent outbreak of poisonings and at least one death associated with products containing A. muscaria extracts has sparked debates regarding the regulatory status of Amanita mushrooms and their psychoactive constituents, prompting an FDA ban of their use in food products in December 2024. These products often use misleading advertising, e.g. making erroneous comparisons to psilocybin mushrooms or not disclosing the inclusion of Amanitas on the packaging.\n\n\nOther reports and theories\nThe Finnish historian T. I. Itkonen mentions that A. muscaria was once used among the Sámi peoples. Sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken published an article in which they claimed to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A. muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it was known as miskwedo (an abbreviation of the name oshtimisk wajashkwedo (= \"red-top mushroom\"). This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of A. muscaria. \nMycophilosopher Martijn Benders has proposed a novel evolutionary theory involving A. muscaria. In his book Amanita Muscaria – the Book of the Empress, he argues that a precursor of ibotenic acid, a compound found in the mushroom, was present in ancient seaweed and played a significant role in the evolution of life. According to this hypothesis, the compound influenced the twitching movements of early aquatic organisms, leading to the development of behaviors such as jumping onto land—a crucial step in the evolution of terrestrial species.\n\nThe flying reindeer of Santa Claus, who is called Joulupukki in Finland, could symbolise the use of A. muscaria by Sámi shamans. However, Sámi scholars and the Sámi peoples themselves refute any connection between Santa Claus and Sámi history or culture.The story of Santa emerging from a Sámi shamanic tradition has a critical number of flaws,\" asserts Tim Frandy, assistant professor of Nordic Studies at the University of British Columbia and a member of the Sámi descendent community in North America. \"The theory has been widely criticized by Sámi people as a stereotypical and problematic romanticized misreading of actual Sámi culture.\n\n\nVikings\nThe notion that Vikings used A. muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be \"very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright\". Comparative analysis of symptoms have, however, since shown Hyoscyamus niger to be a better fit to the state that characterises the berserker rage.\n\n\nSoma\n\nIn 1968, R. Gordon Wasson proposed that A. muscaria was the soma talked about in the Rigveda of India, a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time. He noted that descriptions of soma omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom, and used the adjective hári \"dazzling\" or \"flaming\" which the author interprets as meaning red. One line described men urinating soma; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming \"from the mountains\", which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan migrants from the north. Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were prescribed, using as a source the Manusmṛti.\nIn 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma. In his 1976 survey, Hallucinogens and Culture, anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour. Kevin Feeney and Trent Austin compared the references in the Vedas with the filtering mechanisms in the preparation of A. muscaria and published findings supporting the proposal that fly-agaric mushrooms could be a likely candidate for the sacrament. Other proposed candidates include Psilocybe cubensis, Peganum harmala, and Ephedra.\n\n\nChristianity\n\nPhilologist, archaeologist, and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro postulated that early Christian theology was derived from a fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption of A. muscaria in his 1970 book The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. This theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology. The book was widely criticised by academics and theologians, including Sir Godfrey Driver, emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at Oxford University and Henry Chadwick, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been \"the best kept secret in the world\" as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.",
    "Fly trap": "Amanita muscaria is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of ibotenic acid and muscimol, which lead to its common name \"fly agaric\". Recently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.",
    "Culinary": "The toxins in A. muscaria are water-soluble: parboiling A. muscaria fruit bodies can detoxify them and render them edible, although consumption of the mushroom as a food has never been widespread. The consumption of detoxified A. muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A. muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must also be detoxified before consumption.\nUse of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A. muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.\nA 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives a history of consumption of A. muscaria as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that A. muscaria be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are also toxic unless properly cooked.",
    "In culture": "The red-and-white spotted toadstool is a common image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. For instance, in Hieronymus Bosch's painting, The Garden of Earthly Delights, the mushroom can be seen on the left-hand panel of the work. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two of the most famous uses of the mushroom are in the Mario franchise (specifically two of the Super Mushroom power-up items and the platforms in several stages which are based on a fly agaric), and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.\nAn account of the journeys of Philip von Strahlenberg to Siberia and his descriptions of the use of the mukhomor there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith in his widely read 1762 novel, Citizen of the World. The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time. Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his books The Seven Sisters of Sleep and A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi. This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A hallucinogenic \"scarlet toadstool\" from Lappland is featured as a plot element in Charles Kingsley's 1866 novel Hereward the Wake based on the medieval figure of the same name. Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel Gravity's Rainbow describes the fungus as a \"relative of the poisonous Destroying angel\" and presents a detailed description of a character preparing a cookie bake mixture from harvested A. muscaria. Fly agaric shamanism—in the context of a surviving Dionysian cult in the Peak District—is also explored in the 2003 novel Thursbitch by Alan Garner."

  "Amanita pantherina": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita pantherina, also known as the panther cap, false blusher, and the panther amanita due to its similarity to the true blusher (Amanita rubescens), is a species of fungus found in Eurasia with poisonous and psychoactive properties.",
    "Description": "The cap is 5–18 centimetres (2–7 inches) wide, hemispheric at first, then convex to plano-convex, deep brown to hazel-brown to pale ochraceous brown, densely distributed warts that are pure white to sordid cream, minutely verruculose, floccose, easily removable. Viscid when wet, with a short striate margin. The flesh is white, unchanging when injured.\nThe gills are adnexed to free, close to crowded, white becoming greyish, truncate.\nThe spores are white in deposit, smooth, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid to elongate, inamyloid, infrequently globose. 8–14 x 6–10 μm.\nThe stipe is 5–15 cm long × .6–3 cm wide, subcylindric, somewhat narrowing upward, white, becoming slightly tannish in age, stuffed then hollow, finely floccose becoming smooth above the ring, and with small appressed squamules or creamy floccose material below. The volva is white, becoming grey with age, forming one or sometimes two narrow hoop-like rings just above the bulbous base. The flesh is white, unchanging when injured.\nThe odour is unpleasant or like raw potatoes.",
    "Identifying features": "Other than the brownish cap with white warts, distinguishing features of A. pantherina include the collar-like roll of volval tissue at the top of the basal bulb, and the elliptical, inamyloid spores. Unlike A. rubescens, the panther cap does not color red/pink (\"blush\") when the flesh is damaged, hence its name \"false blusher\". This is a key feature in differentiating both species.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The panther cap is an uncommon mushroom, found in both deciduous, especially beech and, less frequently, coniferous woodland and rarely meadows throughout Europe, western Asia in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe and Asia. \nIt is an ectomycorrhizal fungus, living in root symbiosis with a tree, deriving photosynthesised nutrients from it and providing soil nutrients in return.",
    "Toxicity": "A. pantherina is toxic, more so than A. muscaria. It can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and hyperhidrosis, which can lead to severe dehydration. \nVarieties multisquamosa and velatipes are considered poisonous.",
    "Psychoactive use": "A. pantherina contains the psychoactive compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol, two psychoactive constituents which can cause effects such as hallucinations, synaesthesia, euphoria, dysphoria and retrograde amnesia. The effects of muscimol and ibotenic acid most closely resemble that of a Z drug, like Ambien at high doses, and not a classical psychedelic, e.g. psilocybin.\nA. pantherina is used as an entheogen much less often than its much more distinguishable relative A. muscaria, largely due to being less recognizable and far more potent. A. muscaria contains a higher concentration of ibotenic acid. While ibotenic acid is mostly broken down by the body into muscimol, what remains of the ibotenic acid is believed to cause the majority of dysphoric effects of consuming psychoactive Amanita species. Ibotenic acid is also a scientifically important neurotoxin used in lab research as a brain-lesioning agent in mice. \nAs with other wild-growing mushrooms, the ratio of ibotenic acid to muscimol depends on countless external factors, including: season, age, and habitat—and percentages will naturally vary from mushroom to mushroom—with dark brown A. pantherina specimens having a greater concentration of ibotenic acid.",
    "Legal status": "A. muscaria and A. pantherina are illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the Netherlands since December 2008. Possession of amounts larger than 0.5 g dried or 5 g fresh lead to a criminal charge."

  "Amanita persicina": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita persicina, commonly known as the peach-colored fly agaric, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Amanita with a peach-colored center. Until c. 2015, the fungus was believed to be a variety of A. muscaria.\nA. persicina is distributed in eastern North America. It is both poisonous and psychoactive.",
    "Taxonomy": "Amanita persicina was formerly treated as a variety of A. muscaria (the fly agaric) and it was classified as A. muscaria var. persicina. Recent DNA evidence, however, has indicated that A. persicina is better treated as a distinct species, and it was elevated to species status in 2015 by Tulloss & Geml.",
    "Cap": "The cap is 4–13 centimetres (1+1⁄2–5 inches) wide, hemispheric to convex when young, becoming plano-convex to plano-depressed in age. It is pinkish-melon-colored to peach-orange, sometimes pastel red towards the disc. The cap is slightly appendiculate. The volva is distributed over the cap as thin pale yellowish to pale tannish warts; it is otherwise smooth and subviscid, and the margin becomes slightly to moderately striate in age. The flesh is white and does not stain when cut or injured. The flesh has a pleasant taste and odor.",
    "Gills": "The gills are free, crowded, moderately broad, creamy with a pale pinkish tint, and have a very floccose edge. They are abruptly truncate.",
    "Spores": "Amanita persicina spores are white in deposit, ellipsoid to elongate, infrequently broadly ellipsoid, rarely cylindric, inamyloid, and are (8.0) 9.4–12.7 (18.0) x (5.5) 6.5–8.5 (11.1) μm.",
    "Stipe": "The stipe is 4–10.5 cm long, 1–2 cm wide, and more or less equal or narrowing upwards and slightly flaring at the apex. It is pale yellow in the superior region, tannish white below, and densely stuffed with a pith. The ring is fragile, white above and yellowish below, and poorly formed or absent. Remnants of the universal veil on the vasal bulb as concentric rings are fragile or absent.",
    "Chemistry": "This species contains variable amounts of the neurotoxic compound ibotenic acid and the psychoactive compound muscimol.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "A. persicina is found growing solitary or gregariously. It is mycorrhizal with conifers (Pine) and deciduous (Oak) trees in North America. It often fruits in the fall, but sometimes in the spring and summer. The fungus is common in the southeast United States, from Texas to Georgia, and north to New Jersey.",
    "Toxicity": "A. persicina is both poisonous and psychoactive if not properly prepared by parboiling. Pending further research, it should not be eaten."

  "Amanita phalloides": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita phalloides ( AM-ə-NY-tə fə-LOY-deez), commonly known as the death cap, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus and mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. Originating in Europe but later introduced to other parts of the world since the late twentieth century, A. phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe and gills. The cap colour is variable, including white forms, and is thus not a reliable identifier.\nThese toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species (most notably Caesar's mushroom and the straw mushroom) commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental poisoning. Amatoxins, the class of toxins found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat and cold, so their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking nor freezing.\nAmanita phalloides is the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It is also the deadliest mushroom worldwide, responsible for 90% of mushroom-related fatalities every year. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has also been the subject of much research and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-Amanitin, which causes liver and kidney failure.",
    "Taxonomy": "The death cap is named in Latin as such in the correspondence between the English physician Thomas Browne and Christopher Merrett. It was described by French botanist Sébastien Vaillant in 1727, who gave a succinct phrase name \"Fungus phalloides, annulatus, sordide virescens, et patulus\" (a phallus-shaped, ring-stemmed, dirty green mushroom with a large 'spreading' cap).\nIn 1821, Elias Magnus Fries described it as Agaricus phalloides, but included all white amanitas within its description. Finally, in 1833, Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link settled on the name Amanita phalloides, after Persoon had named it Amanita viridis 30 years earlier. Although Louis Secretan's use of the name A. phalloides predates Link's, it has been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan's works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently; some taxonomists have, however, disagreed with this opinion.\nAmanita phalloides is the type species of Amanita section Phalloideae, a group that contains all of the deadly poisonous Amanita species thus far identified. Most notable of these are the species known as destroying angels, namely A. virosa, A. bisporigera and A. ocreata, as well as the fool's mushroom (A. verna). The term \"destroying angel\" has been applied to A. phalloides at times, but \"death cap\" is by far the most common vernacular name used in English. Other common names also listed include \"stinking amanita\" and \"deadly amanita\".\nA rarely appearing, all-white form was initially described A. phalloides f. alba by Max Britzelmayr, though its status has been unclear. It is often found growing amid normally colored death caps. It has been described, in 2004, as a distinct variety and includes what was termed A. verna var. tarda. The true A. verna fruits in spring and turns yellow with KOH solution, whereas A. phalloides never does.",
    "Description": "The death cap has a large and imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp), usually with a pileus (cap) from 5 to 15 cm across (2 to 5.8 inches) across, initially rounded and hemispherical, but flattening with age. The color of the cap can be pale-green, yellowish-green, olive-green, bronze, or (in one form) white; it is often paler toward the margins, which can have darker streaks; it is also often paler after rain. The cap surface is sticky when wet and easily peeled—a troublesome feature, as that is allegedly a feature of edible fungi. The remains of the partial veil are seen as a skirtlike, floppy annulus usually about 1 to 1.5 cm (3⁄8 to 5⁄8 in) below the cap. The crowded white lamellae (gills) are free. The stipe is white with a scattering of grayish-olive scales and is 8 to 15 cm (3+1⁄8 to 5+7⁄8 in) long and 1 to 2 cm (3⁄8 to 3⁄4 in) thick, with a swollen, ragged, sac-like white volva (base). As the volva, which may be hidden by leaf litter, is a distinctive and diagnostic feature, it is important to remove some debris to check for it. Spores: 7-12 x 6-9 μm. Smooth, ellipsoid, amyloid.\nThe smell has been described as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10 μm (0.3–0.4 mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.",
    "Biochemistry": "The species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins, both multicyclic (ring-shaped) peptides spread throughout the mushroom, tissue: the amatoxins and the phallotoxins. Another toxin is phallolysin, which has shown some hemolytic (red blood cell–destroying) activity in vitro. An unrelated compound, antamanide, has also been isolated.\nAmatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-Amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind to a halt and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.\nThe phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds, all of which have seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was isolated in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add little to the death cap's toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible (and sought-after) blusher (A. rubescens). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins, they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.\nThe genome of the death cap has been sequenced.",
    "Similarity to edible species": "A. phalloides is similar to the edible paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) and A. princeps, commonly known as \"white Caesar\".\nSome may mistake juvenile death caps for edible puffballs or mature specimens for other edible Amanita species, such as A. lanei, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of Amanita species for the table altogether. The white form of A. phalloides may be mistaken for edible species of Agaricus, especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of Agaricus have dark-colored gills.\nIn Europe, other similarly green-capped species collected by mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills of the genus Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre, now regarded as hazardous owing to a series of restaurant poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R. aeruginea, and R. virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring. Other similar species include A. subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A. arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north at least as far as central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The death cap is native to Europe, where it is widespread. It is found from the southern coastal regions of Scandinavia in the north, to Ireland in the west, east to Poland and western Russia, and south throughout the Balkans, in Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal in the Mediterranean basin, and in Morocco and Algeria in north Africa. In west Asia, it has been reported from forests of northern Iran. There are records from further east in Asia but these have yet to be confirmed as A. phalloides.\nBy the end of the 19th century, Charles Horton Peck had reported A. phalloides in North America. In 1918, samples from the eastern United States were identified as being a distinct though similar species, A. brunnescens, by George Francis Atkinson of Cornell University. By the 1970s, it had become clear that A. phalloides does occur in the United States, apparently having been introduced from Europe alongside chestnuts, with populations on the West and East Coasts. A 2006 historical review concluded the East Coast populations were inadvertently introduced, likely on the roots of other purposely imported plants such as chestnuts. The origins of the West Coast populations remained unclear, due to scant historical records, but a 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus on the west coast of North America. Observations of various collections of A. phalloides, from conifers rather than native forests, have led to the hypothesis that the species was introduced to North America multiple times. It is hypothesized that the various introductions led to multiple genotypes which are adapted to either oaks or conifers.\nA. phalloides were conveyed to new countries across the Southern Hemisphere with the importation of hardwoods and conifers in the late twentieth century. Introduced oaks appear to have been the vector to Australia and South America; populations under oaks have been recorded from Melbourne, Canberra (where two people died in January 2012, of four who were poisoned), Adelaide, and further observed by citizen scientists in Beechworth, Sydney and Albury.\nIt has been recorded under other introduced trees in Argentina. Pine plantations are associated with the fungus in Tanzania and South Africa, found under oaks and poplars in Chile, as well as Uruguay. \nA number of deaths in India have been attributed to it.",
    "Ecology": "It is ectomycorrhizally associated with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, A. phalloides may also be associated with these trees or with only some species. In coastal California, for example, A. phalloides is associated with coast live oak. In countries where it has been introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range. There is, however, evidence of A. phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand, suggesting that the species may have invasive potential. It may have also been anthropogenically introduced to the island of Cyprus, where it has been documented to fruit within Corylus avellana plantations.",
    "Toxicity": "The fungus is highly toxic, and is responsible for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and 30 grams (1.1 ounces), or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. On average, one person dies a year in North America from death cap ingestion. The toxins of the death cap mushrooms primarily target the liver, but other organs, such as the kidneys, are also affected. Symptoms of death cap mushroom toxicity usually occur 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Symptoms of ingestion of the death cap mushroom may include nausea and vomiting, which is then followed by jaundice, seizures, and coma, which will lead to death. The mortality rate of ingestion of the death cap mushroom is believed to be around 10–30%.\nSome authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.\nPoisoning incidents usually result from errors in identification. Recent cases highlight the issue of the similarity of A. phalloides to the edible paddy straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea), with East and Southeast Asian immigrants in Australia and the West Coast of the U.S. falling victim. In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants. Many North American incidents of death cap poisoning have occurred among Laotian and Hmong immigrants, since it is easily confused with A. princeps (\"white Caesar\"), a popular mushroom in their native countries. Of the nine people poisoned in Australia's Canberra region between 1988 and 2011, three were from Laos and two were from China. In January 2012, four people were accidentally poisoned when death caps (reportedly misidentified as straw mushrooms, which are popular in Chinese and other Asian dishes) were served for dinner in Canberra; all the victims required hospital treatment and two of them died, with a third requiring a liver transplant.",
    "Detection": "The so-called Meixner test is used to detect the presence of amatoxins in a sample. The test gives false positive results for psilocin, psilocybin, and 5-substituted tryptamines.",
    "Signs and symptoms": "Death caps have been reported to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes them particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning. \nIt is noticed that after up to 24 hours have passed, the symptoms seem to disappear and the person might feel fine for up to 72 hours. Symptoms of liver and kidney damage start 3 to 6 days after the mushrooms were eaten, with the considerable increase of the transaminases.\nMushroom poisoning is more common in Europe than in North America. Up to the mid-20th century, the mortality rate was around 60–70%, but this has been greatly reduced with advances in medical care. A review of death cap poisoning throughout Europe from 1971 to 1980 found the overall mortality rate to be 22.4% (51.3% in children under ten and 16.5% in those older than ten). This was revised to around 10–15% in surveys reviewed in 1995.",
    "Treatment": "Consumption of the death cap is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization. The four main categories of therapy for poisoning are preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and liver transplantation.\nPreliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage; due to the delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is common for patients to arrive for treatment many hours after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.\nNo definitive antidote is available, but some specific treatments have been shown to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.\nSLCO1B3 has been identified as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; moreover, substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, ciclosporin and prednisolone—may be useful for the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.\nN-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.\nIn patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.",
    "Notable victims": "Several historical figures may have died from A. phalloides poisoning (or other similar toxic Amanita species). These were either accidental poisonings or assassination plots. Alleged victims of this kind of poisoning include Roman Emperor Claudius, Pope Clement VII, the Russian tsaritsa Natalia Naryshkina, and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.\nR. Gordon Wasson recounted the details of these deaths, noting the likelihood of Amanita poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness that led to his death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning. Natalya Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.\nCharles VI, Holy Roman Emperor experienced indigestion after eating a dish of sautéed mushrooms in October 1740. This led to an illness from which he died 10 days later—symptomatology consistent with amatoxin poisoning. His death caused the end of the agnatic line of the House of Habsburg and led to the War of the Austrian Succession. Noted Voltaire, \"this mushroom dish has changed the destiny of Europe.\"\nThe case of Claudius's poisoning is more complex. Claudius was known to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness. Other historians have speculated that Claudius may have died of natural causes.\nIn the 2023 Leongatha mushroom murders, Australian woman Erin Patterson was found guilty of three murders and one attempted murder of members of her estranged husband's family by serving them beef Wellingtons that contained A. phalloides. Three of the four guests died within days of the meal, while one survived after a liver transplant and weeks in a coma.",

  "Amanita rubescens": {
    "Introduction": "The blusher is the common name for several closely related species of the genus Amanita. A. rubescens (the blushing amanita) is found in Eurasia and A. novinupta (the new bride blushing amanita or blushing bride) is found in western North America. Both their scientific and common names stem from the tendency of their flesh to bruise pink.\nBlushers are difficult to distinguish from similar species, but one identifying feature is the pink bruising. The mushroom is edible and tasty, sought for in several European countries.",
    "Taxonomy": "Amanita rubescens is native to Europe and Asia, with related species being confused for it in other regions. Amanita novinupta can be found in western North America.\nOther closely related species and variants include Amanita brunneolocularis,  A. orsonii, A. rubescens var. alba, and A. rubescens var. congolensis.",
    "Description": "A. rubescens has a reddish-brown convex pileus (cap), which is 5–15 centimetres (2–6 inches) across, and strewn with small white-to-mahogany warts. It is sometimes covered with an ochre-yellow flush which can be washed by the rain. The flesh of the mushroom is white, becoming pink when bruised or exposed to air. The stipe (stem) is white with flushes of the cap colour, and grows to 5–15 cm. The gills are white and free of the stem, and display red spots when damaged. The ring is striate (i.e. has ridges) on its upper side. The spores are white, ovate, amyloid, and approximately 8 by 5 μm in size. The flavour of the uncooked flesh is mild, but has a faint acrid aftertaste. The smell is not strong.\nA. novinupta has a whitish cap 5–15 cm wide and stem up to 12 cm long. It also blushes pink and has a mild smell and white spore print.",
    "Similar species": "Several related species are difficult to distinguish. The pink blush is a key feature in differentiating blushers from A. pantherina (the poisonous false blusher), the flesh of which does not. A. pantherina also lacks a striate ring.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "A. rubescens is common throughout much of Europe and Asia. It grows on poor soils as well as in deciduous and coniferous woodlands, appearing from June through to November in the United Kingdom. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe. \nA. novinupta is found in western North America, especially California. Additionally, there are several North American species known as A. amerirubescens.",
    "Ecology": "In eastern North America, species in the A. rubescens group are frequently parasitized by Hypomyces hyalinus.  Parasitized fruiting bodies are extremely difficult to recognize unless they occur in conjunction with healthy ones, although some retain the \"blushing\" characteristic of the species.",
    "Uses": "A. rubescens is edible when cooked. A. rubescens contains a toxic hemolytic protein in its raw state, although it is not apparently harmful to consume and can be destroyed by cooking. It is noted in some mushroom books as poisonous, with David Pegler stating that if eaten raw in large quantities it can cause severe anaemia if left untreated; Pegler classifies it as a blood cell-damaging (haemolytic-poisoning) mushroom. It also resembles some toxic species.",

  "Amanita velosa": {
    "Introduction": "Amanita velosa, commonly known as the springtime amanita, or bittersweet orange ringless amanita is a species of agaric found in California, as well as southern Oregon and Baja California. Although a prized edible mushroom, it bears similarities to some deadly poisonous species.",
    "Description": "It is part of Amanita section Vaginatae, and like other species in this group, it is characterized by its lack of an annulus, striate pileus margin, thick universal veil remnants comprising the veil, volva, and pileus patches, inamyloid spores, and lack of  characteristic Amanita toxins such as amatoxins and ibotenic acid. It is distinguished from other species in section Vaginatae by its lack of any kind of umbo on its pileus, its short pileus striae, and its distinct pale orange to pale salmon coloration when young. Its coloration can become more brownish with age and entirely white specimens are occasionally seen as well. Like many other Amanita, the gills are white, but occasionally have a distinct pinkish or orangish tint. In older specimens, the odor can become pungent and fishy.\nThe cap is 5–15 cm wide, convex then plane, with an orange-pink or salmon-like color; it usually has a white universal veil patch. The gills are adnexed to free, close and white (or pinkish with age). The stalk is 5–15 cm long, and 1–3 cm wide. The volva is white, saclike and sheathes the stalk base. The spores are white, smooth, elliptical, and inamyloid.",
    "Similar species": "The deadly A. ocreata and occasionally A. phalloides are found in the same habitat at the same time of year as A. velosa, and can often be found in close proximity. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. A. calyptratoides is very similar.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "A. velosa is a late-season mushroom in its range of occurrence, being primarily found in the coastal regions of California, Oregon, and Baja California, from midwinter up until the end of the California rainy season. Its favored habitat is the ecotone between oak (particularly coast live oak) woodlands and open grassland, living in an ectomycorrhizal relationship with young oak trees.\nThe species is also reported to have been found in association with aspen and conifers in the Sierra Nevada, with one report of it being found growing with spruce in the eastern United States' Great Smoky Mountains National Park.",
    "Edibility": "It is considered to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor, but great caution must be exercised to properly identify it due to its similarity to deadly species."

  "Apioperdon pyriforme": {
    "Introduction": "Apioperdon pyriforme, commonly known as the pear-shaped puffball or stump puffball, is a species of fungus. It is often called Lycoperdon pyriforme, but was transferred to Apioperdon in 2017. It is the only species in the genus.\nIt is a saprobic fungus present throughout much of the world, growing on decaying wood. It is considered a choice edible when still immature and the inner flesh is white.",
    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was first described in the scientific literature by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774. In 2001, DNA evidence compiled by Dirk Krüger and a number of other mycologists suggested that the genus Lycoperdon was polyphyletic, with the pear-shaped puffball differing most significantly from the group. This finding was supported by several morphological differences including the presence of rhizomorphs and its preference for wood.\nA 2003 publication of further research moved the puffball to the genus Morganella with the specific epithet's ending changed for agreement. In 2008, however, Larsson and Jeppson revisited the phylogeny of the Lycoperdaceae, with a broader sampling of species, and retained the taxon in Lycoperdon.  It was renamed Apioperdon pyriforme in 2017 based on phylogenetic and morphological differences. It is the only species in the genus.\nThe specific epithet pyriforme is Latin for \"pear-shaped\".",
    "Description": "The fruit body of the pear-shaped puffball measures up to 3 centimetres (1+1⁄4 in) wide and 6 cm (2+1⁄4 in) tall. They are often pear-shaped as the name suggests, but they may also be nearly spherical. When very young they are covered in small white spines that typically fall off before maturity. A small developing pore may be visible at the top, while the sterile base of the mushroom is small and appears to be pinched in. Colour ranges from nearly white to yellowish brown with the darker shades developing with age, though the base remains white. The central pore ruptures at late maturity to allow the wind and rain to disperse the spores. The base is attached to the wood by means of rhizomorphs (thick, cord-like strands of mycelium).\n\nThe gleba, or inner spore mass, is white when young, but it becomes greenish-yellow to dark olive-brown with age. The spores measure 3 to 4.5 μm and are round, smooth and a dark olive-brown in colour.",
    "Similar species": "The closely related common puffball, Lycoperdon perlatum is a similar-appearing species, as are the poisonous, unrelated common earthball, Scleroderma citrinum and other species of Scleroderma.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It can be found throughout Europe from July to December. In western North America, it appears from fall to winter. It grows on decaying wood.",
    "Edibility": "The fungus is a choice edible when still immature and the inner flesh is white. Additionally, one guide says that the puffballs are edible when densely fruited. They can be used fresh, or cut into thin slices for drying, which can then be pulverized for use as a flavoring powder.\nCaution should be used as similar-looking species in Scleroderma (such as S. citrinum) are poisonous."

  "Armillaria mellea": {
    "Introduction": "Armillaria mellea, commonly known as honey fungus, is an edible basidiomycete fungus in the genus Armillaria. It is a plant pathogen and part of a cryptic species complex of closely related and morphologically similar species. It causes Armillaria root rot in many plant species and produces mushrooms around the base of trees it has infected. The symptoms of infection appear in the crowns of infected trees as discoloured foliage, reduced growth, dieback of the branches and death. The mycelium is capable of producing light via bioluminescence.\nThe mushroom is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows on hardwoods but may be found around and on other living and dead wood or in open areas.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally named Agaricus melleus by Danish-Norwegian botanist Martin Vahl in 1790; it was transferred to the genus Armillaria in 1871 by Paul Kummer. Numerous subtaxa have been described:\n\nMycoBank also lists f. mellea, subsp. mellea, and var. mellea as current with a \"(?)\".",
    "Reclassified species": "Armillaria mellea once included a range of species with similar features that have since been reclassified. The following are reassigned subtaxa, mostly variety-level entries from the 19th century:",
    "Common names": "It is commonly known as honey fungus, stump mushroom, stumpie, honey mushroom, pipinky or pinky,",
    "Description": "The basidiocarp of each has a smooth cap 3 to 15 cm (1 to 6 in) in diameter, convex at first but becoming flattened with age often with a central raised umbo, later becoming somewhat dish-shaped. The margins of the cap are often arched at maturity and the surface is sticky when wet. Though typically honey-coloured, this fungus is rather variable in appearance and sometimes has a few dark, hairy scales near the centre somewhat radially arranged. The gills are white at first, sometimes becoming pinkish-yellow or discoloured with age, broad and fairly distant, attached to the stipe at right angles or are slightly decurrent. The flesh of the cap is whitish and has a sweetish odour and flavour with a tinge of bitterness.\nThe stipe is 5–20 cm (2–8 in) long and 0.5–3.5 cm (1⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) in diameter. It is fibrillose and of a firm spongy consistency at first but later becomes hollow. It is cylindrical and tapers to a point at its base where it is fused to the stipes of other mushrooms in the clump. It is whitish at the upper end and brownish-yellow below, often with a very dark-coloured base. There is a broad persistent skin-like ring attached to the upper part of the stipe. This has a velvety margin and yellowish fluff underneath and extends outwards as a white partial veil protecting the gills when young.\nUnder the microscope, the spores are approximately elliptical, 6–9 by 5–7 μm, inamyloid with prominent apiculi (short, pointed projections) at the base. The spore print is white. The basidia (spore-producing structures) lack basal clamps.\nThe main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. They are bundled together in rhizomorphs that are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia are luminous when in active growth.",
    "Similar species": "In addition to a number of reclassified species, Armillaria gemina lacks the yellow cap background and A. nabsnona has a darker hue.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Armillaria mellea is widespread in northern temperate zones. It has been found throughout North America, and in Europe and northern Asia. It has been introduced to South Africa. It grows parasitically on a large number of broadleaf trees.  It fruits in dense clusters at the base of trunks or stumps.",
    "Ecology": "Armillaria mellea prefers moist soil and lower soil temperatures but it can also withstand extreme temperatures, such as forest fires, due to the protection of the soil. It is found in many kinds of landscapes, including gardens, parks, vineyards, tree production areas, and natural landscapes.\nArmillaria mellea typically is symbiotic with hardwood trees and conifers, including orchards, planted forests, vineyards, and a few herbaceous plants. It infects new hosts through rhizomorphs and basidiospores. It is rare for basidiospores to be successful in infecting new hosts and often colonize woody debris instead, but rhizomorphs, however, can grow up to ten feet long in order to find a new host.\nThere are few signs, and they are often difficult to observe. The most prominent sign is honey-coloured mushrooms at the base of the infected plant. Additional signs include white, fan-shaped mycelia and black rhizomorphs with diameters between 1⁄32 and 1⁄8 inch (0.8 and 3.2 mm). These usually are not as noticeable because they occur beneath the bark and in the soil, respectively. The symptoms are much more numerous, including slower growth, dieback of branches, yellowing foliage, rotted wood at base and/or roots, external cankers, cracking bark, bleeding stem, leaf wilting, defoliation, and rapid death. Leaf wilting, defoliation, and dieback occur after the destruction of the cambium.\nIt is one of the most common causes of death in trees and shrubs in both natural and cultivated habitats, and cause steady and substantial losses.",
    "Disease cycle": "Armillaria mellea infects both through basidiospore and penetration of host species by rhizomorphs which can grow up to 1 meter (39 in) long per year to find new, living tissue to infect. However, infection of living host tissue through basidiospores is quite rare. Two basidiospores must germinate and fuse to be viable and produce mycelium. In the late summer and autumn, Armillaria mellea produces mushrooms with notched gills, a ring near the cap base, and a white to golden color. They do not always appear, but when they do they can be found on both living and dead trees near the ground. These mushrooms produce and release the sexually created basidiospore which is dispersed by the wind. This is the only spore-bearing phase. The fungus overwinters as either rhizomorphs or vegetative mycelium. Infected wood is weakened through decay in roots and tree base after destruction of the vascular cambium and underlying wood.\nTrees become infected when rhizomorphs growing through the soil encounter uninfected roots. Alternatively, when infected roots come into contact with uninfected ones the fungal mycelium may grow across. The rhizomorphs invade the trunk, growing between the bark and the wood and causing wood decay, growth reduction and mortality. Trees that are already under stress are more likely to be attacked but healthy trees may also be parasitized. The foliage becomes sparse and discoloured, twig growth slows down and branches may die back. When they are attacked, the Douglas-fir, western larch and some other conifers often produce an extra large crop of cones shortly before dying. Coniferous trees also tend to ooze resin from infected areas whereas broad-leaved trees sometimes develop sunken cankers. A growth of fruiting bodies near the base of the trunk confirms the suspicion of Armillaria root rot.\nIn 1893, the American mycologist Charles Horton Peck reported finding Armillaria fruiting bodies that were \"aborted\", in a similar way to specimens of Entoloma abortivum. It was not until 1974 that Roy Watling showed that the aborted specimens included cells of both Armillaria mellea and Entoloma abortivum. He thought that the Armillaria was parasitizing the Entoloma, a plausible hypothesis given its pathogenic behaviour. However, a 2001 study by Czederpiltz, Volk and Burdsall showed that the Entoloma was in fact the microparasite. The whitish-grey malformed fruit bodies known as carpophoroids were the result of E. abortivum hyphae penetrating the Armillaria and disrupting its normal development.\nThe main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. The rhizomorphs of are initiated from mycelium into multicellular apices of rhizomorphs, which are multicellular vegetative organs that exclude soil from the interior of the rhizomorph tissues. The rhizomorphs spread through far greater distances through the ground than the mycelium. The rhizomorphs are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia and rhizomorphs are luminous when in active growth. A. mellea producing rhizomorphs is parasitic on woody plants of many species, including especially shrubs, hardwood and evergreen trees. In one example, A. mellea spread by rhizomorphs from an initially infected tree killed 600 trees in a prune orchard in 6 years. Each infected tree was immediately adjacent to an already infected one, the spread by rhizomorphs through the tree roots and soil.",
    "Management": "There are fungicides or management practices that will kill A. mellea after infection without damaging the infected plant, but these practicies are still being studied. There are practices that can extend the life of the plant and prevent further spreading. The best way to extend the plant life is to improve the host condition through supplemental watering and fertilization. To prevent further spread, it is recommended to regulate irrigation to avoid water stress, keep the root collar dry, control defoliating pathogens, remove stumps, fertilize adequately, avoid physical root damage and soil compaction, and to not plant trees that are especially susceptible to the disease in places where A. mellea has been recorded. There is also some evidence that biological control using the fungus genus Trichoderma may help. Trichoderma is a predator of A. mellea and is often found in woodchips. Therefore, chipping or grinding dead and infected roots will give Trichoderma its preferred habitat and help it proliferate. Solarization will also create an ideal habitat as dry soil and higher soil temperatures are preferable for Trichoderma but poor conditions for A. mellea.",
    "Cultivation": "Cultivation of A. mellea started with cultivation of its mycellia, which is used to support the cultivation of Gastrodia elata, a non-photosynthetic plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. This kind of cultivation has been present since 1994 and uses pieces of wood inoculated with the fungus. In 2017, farmers from Heilongjiang succeeded in producing fruiting bodies (mushrooms) through cultivation. By 2019, the spent myceliated wood from Gastrodia cultivation is routinely used to seed new wood for mushroom production.",
    "Uses": "Armillaria melleais considered a good edible mushroom, but is not preferred by some, and the tough stalks are usually excluded. They are best collected when young and thoroughly cooked. Specimens such as those growing on buckeye or hemlock can cause gastrointestinal upset.\nThe mushrooms have a taste that has been described as slightly sweet and nutty, with a texture ranging from chewy to crunchy, depending on the method of preparation. Parboiling mushrooms before consuming removes the bitter taste present in some specimens and may reduce the amount of gastrointestinal irritants. According to one guide, they must be cooked before eating. Drying the mushrooms preserves and intensifies their flavour, although reconstituted mushrooms tend to be tough to eat. The mushrooms can also be pickled and roasted.\nDiflerent nutritional parameters of A. mellea, like protein, carbohydrale, fat, amino acid and crude have been studied. The fruit body contains large amounts of carbohydrates including polysaccharides such as glucans and glycogen, monosaccharides and disaccharides (such as trehalose), sugar, alcohols (such as manitol) and chitin. The mushroom is rich in protein and carbohydrate but is low amount of fat which could serve a proper diet for persons who sufferer from hypertension and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, due to the presence of high level of crude fiber it could help to control diabetes and obesity.\nThe mushrooms also may have been used medicinally by indigenous peoples as a laxative.",
    "Chemistry": "Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies. The triterpenes 3β-hydroxyglutin-5-ene,  friedelane-2α,3β-diol, and friedelin were reported in 2011. Indole compounds include tryptamine, L-tryptophan and serotonin.\nThe fungus produces cytotoxic compounds known as melleolides. Melleolides are made from orsellinic acid and protoilludane sesquiterpene alcohols via esterification. A polyketide synthase gene, termed ArmB, was identified in the genome of the fungus, which was found expressed during melleolide production. The gene shares c. 42% similarity with the orsellinic acid synthase gene (OrsA) in Aspergillus nidulans. Characterization of the gene proved it to catalyze orsillinic acid in vitro. It is a non-reducing iterative type-1 polyketide synthase. Co-incubation of free orsellinic acid with alcohols and ArmB showed cross-coupling activity. Therefore, the enzyme has transesterification activity. Other auxiliary factors are suspected to control substrate specificity. Additionally, halogen modifications have been observed. Overexpression of annotated halogenases (termed ArmH1-5) and characterization of the subsequent enzymes revealed in all five enzymes the chlorination of mellolide F. In vitro reactions of free-standing substrates showed that the enzymes do not require auxiliary carrier proteins for substrate delivery."

  "Armillaria tabescens": {
    "Introduction": "Armillaria tabescens (also known as ringless honey mushroom) is a species of fungus in the family Physalacriaceae. It is a plant pathogen. The mycelium of the fungus is bioluminescent.",
    "Hosts and symptoms": "Armillaria species infect a wide variety of woody plants. In a survey of 250 permanent plots of trees in Albania, Armillaria tabescens affected multiple species of trees including fir species, where it invaded when the plant was stressed. A study in Greece reported Armillaria tabescens to be more prevalent in areas where the trees were stressed due to limited moisture. In oak trees, it was slightly more damaging and could kill young trees. Armillaria tabescens was also recorded in poplar and eucalyptus plantations, and almond trees were found to be very susceptible to infection. The results of the study by Lushaj et al. showed that Armillaria tabescens was most frequently recorded on fruit and ornamental trees compared to the other species.\nArmillaria tabescens causes separation of the bark from the wood by the production of mycelial fans in the trunk, a common sign of Armillaria root rot. It also causes gummosis, patches of gummy material on the surface of plants, which occurs in response to an external stimulus which causes the plant to ooze sap. Other common symptoms are soft rot of cortex, dwarfing, dieback, wilting, and abnormal coloring of the leaves. Small trees are killed rapidly by Armillaria tabescens and the symptoms aren't noticeable until the leaves wilt. However, on larger trees symptoms occur earlier and start as a thin crown with small leaves. A crown of a tree refers to any branches or foliage that are growing out from the trunk. Therefore, thinning of the crown would mean reduced branches and leaves. The trees eventually start yellowing and defoliating followed by fast wilting and dying of limbs. The fungus is a white rot so it breaks down lignin in the wood. The breaking down of the lignin leads to the trees becoming hollow.",
    "Environment": "Armillaria tabescens is found in warm and dry regions, so, in Europe, it tends to be in southern areas. It has also been found in altitudes ranging from sea level to 1,300 metres (4,300 ft). Studies in Europe have found that it exists in south-east England, France, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Greece and, rarely, Germany and Switzerland. In Japan, it is very rare; only one isolate of Armillaria tabescens was found out of 59 sites surveyed.\nArmillaria tabescens grows quickly at 28–30 °C (82–86 °F) and more slowly at 5 °C (41 °F). If the soil is moist, fruiting bodies are abundant. It is the first to fruit in September, compared to Armillaria mellea and Armillaria gallica. The fruiting bodies can be seen even earlier if the season has been exceptionally wet. Armillaria tabescens grows poorly on sand and produces shorter rhizomorphs. Rhizomorphs are threadlike structures in fungi that are made up of hyphae. Hyphae are branching structures that release enzymes to absorb nutrients from the host.",
    "Pathogenesis": "Armillaria tabescens is a heterothallic species of Armillaria. Heterothallic species perform anastomosis when haploid monokaryon come in contact with one another. Anastomosis is the connection or opening between two things, in this case the mycelium. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus that consists of hyphae. If the two monokaryons are sexually compatible they form a clamp connection. This results in a mycelium consisting of dikaryotic cells. The dikaryon cells predominate in the vegetative phase. In the basidia karyogamy occurs before meiosis and then the formation of basidiospores.  The basidiospores then infect the host plant.\nArmillaria tabescens is found to attack trees that are already stressed or have a wound. The pathogen can spread its mycelia and get into the trunk or root of a tree. The fungus has the ability to spread its mycelia throughout the root and trunk system and form mycelial mats. Mycelia is damaging to trees because they absorb the nutrients by secreting enzymes to breakdown the plant material. It specifically breaks down lignin because it is a white rot.\n\nNo rhizomorphs have been found for Armillaria tabescens in nature. However, Rishbeth and Kile did find rhizomorphs buried in the soil on inocula. Since the species doesn't produce rhizomorphs commonly in the nature, infected roots must come into contact with other potential hosts for infection to occur. So, root grafting provides an effective pathway for the spread of this pathogen. Tsopelas conducted an experiment of inoculating almond trees with Armillaria tabescens and two other Armillaria species. The result of the experiment was that basidiocarps developed 6–8 weeks after the inoculation. The basidiocarps are recognized by not having an annulus around the stalk of the basidium. The basidiospores infect the trees. After two years, it only killed 3 out of the 16 trees and two other trees had symptoms of dieback.",
    "Edibility": "The species can be cooked and eaten, even being regarded as choice, but has been reported to cause upset stomachs. Armillaria tabescens additionally contains small levels of antioxidants which have been studied for possible use as protection against lipid peroxidation and free radical damage."

  "Artomyces pyxidatus": {
    "Introduction": "Artomyces pyxidatus is a coral fungus that is commonly called crown coral or crown-tipped coral fungus. Its most characteristic feature is the crown-like shape of the tips of its branches. The epithet pyxidatus means \"box-like\"—a reference to this shape.",
    "Description": "The hard, coral-like fruiting bodies reach 4–10 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4 in) tall. The colour ranges from cream to semi-tan. The branches rise in ringlike arrangements resembling a crown. Basidia and basidiospores are produced on the surfaces of the branches. The spore print is white.\nThe sesquiterpene compounds pyxidatols A-C, tsuicoline E and omphadiol have been obtained from the liquid culture of this fungus.",
    "Similar species": "DNA evidence and microscopy indicates that the species is closely related to members of the genera Russula and Lentinellus, as well as Auriscalpium vulgare. Artomyces piperatus is found on the North American West Coast. Other similar species include Clavulina avellanea, C. cristata, C. divaricata, C. piperata, and C. taxophila. Additionally, Ramaria stricta is similar but lacks crown-like tips.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "In eastern North America, A. pyxidatus appears on decaying wood from June to September. It can be observed throughout Northern Canada during the growing season. In Britain, it was recorded in 2011, almost 116 years after its previous reliable report, a collection made by mycologist Carleton Reale on 20 October 1886. Two subsequent records have been provided in Britain since 2011; one by Yvonne Davidson in Kent in 2018, and one by Cameron Ambler in East Sussex in 2021. Found in Kent in 2023 It is widespread but uncommon in Western Europe. They are also widely found in the pine forest of northeastern India, known as the \"eight sisters of India\".",
    "Uses": "Although usually found in insubstantial quantities, these fungi are considered edible raw, but are better cooked. According to one guide, it is best served when fried with chopped potatoes.\nThe fungus are known to be served as meal amongst the tribal groups of Northeast India since time immemorial."

    "Habitat": "The species is often found on decaying wood.",
    "Potential uses": "The species is inedible.\nBecause it produces enzymes that can degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as those used in synthetic textile dyes, there has been research interest in investigating the fungus for possible use in bioremediation. The research on these lignin-degrading enzymes produced by Bjerkandera adusta, such as versatile peroxidase, has also shown in studies to be able to decolorize synthetic melanin. This feature may allow Bjerkandera adusta to be utilized for melanin decolorization in future cosmetic applications."

  "Boletus edulis": {
    "Introduction": "Boletus edulis (English: cep, penny bun, porcino) is a basidiomycete fungus, and the type species of the genus Boletus. It is prized as an edible mushroom. \nThe fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body has a large brown cap which can reach 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and 3 kg (6 lb 10 oz) in weight. Like other boletes, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than gills; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings (pores). The pore surface of the fruit body is whitish when young, aging to a greenish-yellow. The stout stipe (or stem) is white or yellowish, up to 25 cm (10 in) tall and 7 cm (3 in) thick, and partially covered with a raised network pattern (reticulations).\nThe fungus grows in deciduous and coniferous forests and tree plantations, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere across Eurasia and North America, it does not occur naturally in the Southern Hemisphere but has been introduced to it. Several closely related European mushrooms formerly thought to be varieties or forms of B. edulis have been shown using molecular phylogenetic analysis to be distinct species, while others previously classified as separate species are conspecific with B. edulis. The western North American species commonly known as the California king bolete (B. edulis var. grandedulis) is a large, darker-coloured variant first formally identified in 2007.\nB. edulis is held in high regard in many cuisines and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom is low in fat and digestible carbohydrates, while being high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, it is very difficult to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn throughout Europe and Russia, it is most often dried, packaged, and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying and is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B. edulis is also one of the few fungi sold pickled.",
    "Taxonomy": "Boletus edulis was first described in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written Boletus edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Carl Linnaeus' Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include Boletus solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.\nBoletus edulis is the type species of the genus Boletus. In Rolf Singer's classification of the Agaricales mushrooms, it is also the type species of section Boletus, a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by several characteristics: a mild-tasting, white flesh that does not change colour when exposed to air; a smooth to distinctly raised, netted pattern over at least the uppermost portion of the stem; a yellow-brown or olive-brown spore print; white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish, which initially appear to be stuffed with cotton; and cystidia that are not strongly coloured. Molecular analysis published in 1997 established that the bolete mushrooms are all derived from a common ancestor, and established the Boletales as an order separate from the Agaricales.\nThe generic name is derived from the Latin term bōlētus \"mushroom\", which was borrowed in turn from the Ancient Greek βωλίτης, \"terrestrial fungus\". Ultimately, this last word derives from bōlos/βῶλος \"lump\", \"clod\", and, metaphorically, \"mushroom\". The βωλίτης of Galen, like the boletus of Latin writers like Martial, Seneca and Petronius, is often identified as the much prized Amanita caesarea. The specific epithet edulis in Latin means \"eatable\" or \"edible\".",
    "Common names": "Common names for B. edulis vary by region. The standard Italian name, porcino (pl. porcini), means porcine; fungo porcino, in Italian, echoes the term suilli, literally \"hog mushrooms\", a term used by the Ancient Romans and still in use in southern Italian terms for this species. The derivation has been ascribed to the resemblance of young fruit bodies to piglets, or to the fondness pigs have for eating them. It is also known as \"king bolete\". The English penny bun refers to its rounded brownish shape.\nThe German name Steinpilz (stone mushroom) refers to the species' firm flesh. In Austria, it is called Herrenpilz, the \"noble mushroom\", while in Mexico, the Spanish name is panza, meaning \"belly\". Another Spanish name, rodellon, means \"small round boulder\", while the Dutch name eekhoorntjesbrood means \"squirrel's bread\". Russian names are belyy grib (ru:белый гриб; \"white mushroom\" as opposed to less valuable \"black mushrooms\") and borovik (ru:боровик; from bor—\"pine forest\").\nThe vernacular name cep is derived from the Catalan cep or its French name cèpe, although the latter is a generic term applying to several related species. In France, it is more fully cèpe de Bordeaux, derived from the Gascon cep \"trunk\" for its fat stalk, ultimately from the Latin cippus \"stake\". Ceppatello, ceppatello buono, ceppatello bianco, giallo leonato, ghezzo, and moreccio are names from Italian dialects, and ciurenys or surenys is another term in Catalan. The French-born King Charles XIV John popularised B. edulis in Sweden after 1818, and is honoured in the local vernacular name Karljohanssvamp, as well as the Danish name Karl Johan svamp. The monarch cultivated the fungus about his residence, Rosersberg Palace.",
    "Description": "The cap of this mushroom grows up to 8–30 cm (3–12 in) wide, sometimes more. Viscid when moist, the cap is convex when young and flattens with age. The colour is generally reddish-brown, sometimes with a paler margin. The stipe grows up to 8–25 cm (3–10 in) tall and 2–7 cm (1–3 in) thick—rather large in comparison to the cap. The stem is usually enlarged at the base when young, becoming more cylindrical in age. It is finely reticulate on the upper portion or sometimes the whole. The flesh of the stem is sometimes dark yellow near the base.\nThe undersurface of the cap consists of thin tubes, the site of spore production; they are 1 to 2 cm (1⁄2 to 3⁄4 in) deep, and whitish in colour when young, but mature to a greenish-yellow. The angular pores, which do not stain when bruised, are small—roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre. In youth, the pores are white and appear as if stuffed with cotton (which are actually mycelia); as they age, they change colour to yellow and later to brown. The spore print is olive brown. The flesh of the fruit body is white, thick and firm when young, but becomes somewhat spongy with age. When bruised or cut, it either does not change colour, or turns a very light brown or light red. Mature specimens can weigh about 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz). A huge specimen collected on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in 1995 weighed 3.2 kg (7 lb 1 oz); its cap was 42 cm (16+1⁄2 in) wide and the stipe was 18 cm (7 in) tall and 14 cm (5+1⁄2 in) wide. A similarly sized specimen found in Poland in 2013 made international news.\nThe spores are elliptical to spindle-shaped, with dimensions of 12–17 by 5–7 μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are produced in a layer lining the tubes, and arrange themselves so their ends are facing the center of the tube; this layer of cells is known technically as a hymenium. The basidia are thin-walled, mostly attached to four spores, and measure 25–30 by 8–10 μm. Another cell type present in the hymenium is the cystidia, larger sterile cells that protrude beyond the basidia into the lumen of the hymenium and act as air traps, regulating humidity. B. edulis has pleurocystidia (cystidia located on the face of a pore) that are thin-walled, roughly spindle-shaped to ventricose, and 30–45 by 7–10 μm; the \"stuffed\" feature of the hymenium is caused by cheilocystidia—cells found on the edges of the pores. The hyphae of B. edulis do not have clamp connections.",
    "Similar species": "Boletus edulis is considered one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table, as few poisonous species closely resemble it and those that do may be easily distinguished by careful examination. The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil's bolete (Rubroboletus satanas), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising. It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable Tylopilus felleus, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the \"bolete-like\" Gyroporus castaneus, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem. Boletus huronensis, an uncommon mushroom of northeastern North America, is another recognized look-alike known to cause severe gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n\nRelated species\n\nSeveral similar brownish-coloured species are sometimes considered subspecies or forms of this mushroom. In Europe, in addition to B. edulis (or cèpe de Bordeaux), the most popular are:\n\nCèpe bronzé (\"dark cep\"; Boletus aereus), much rarer than B. edulis, is more highly regarded by gourmets and consequently more expensive. Usually smaller than B. edulis, it is also distinctively darker in colour. It is especially suited to drying.\nCèpe des pins (\"pine tree cep\"; Boletus pinophilus or Boletus pinicola) grows among pine trees. Rarer than B. edulis, it is less appreciated by gourmets than the two other kinds of porcini, but remains a mushroom rated above most others.\nCèpe d'été (\"summer cep\"; Boletus reticulatus), also less common and found earlier.\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses have proven these three are all distinctive and separate species; other taxa formerly believed to be unique species or subspecies, such as B. betulicola, B. chippewaensis, B. persoonii, B. quercicola and B. venturii, are now known to be part of a B. edulis species complex with a wide morphological, ecological and geographic range, and that the genetic variability in this complex is low. Similar molecular technology has been developed to rapidly and accurately identify B. edulis and other commercially important fungi.\nThree divergent lineages found in Yunnan province in China that are commonly marketed and sold as B. edulis (and are actually more closely related to B. aereus) were described in 2013 as B. bainiugan, B. meiweiniuganjun and B. shiyong. The classification has since been updated and expanded. All lineages are still members of Boletus sect. Boletus, the sensu stricto \"porcini clade\" of the genus.\n\nWestern North America has several species closely related to B. edulis. The white king bolete (B. barrowsii), found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (and possibly elsewhere), is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. It is lighter in colour than B. edulis, having a cream-coloured cap with pink tones; often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine, it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find its flavour as good as if not better than B. edulis. The California king bolete (Boletus edulis var. grandedulis) can reach massive proportions, and is distinguished from B. edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish. The cap colour appears to be affected by the amount of light received during its development, and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy, to dark-brown, red-brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light. The queen bolete (Boletus regineus), formerly considered a variety of B. aereus, is also a choice edible. It is generally smaller than B. edulis, and unlike that species, is typically found in mixed forests. The spring king bolete (Boletus rex-veris), formerly considered a variety of B. edulis or B. pinophilus, is found throughout western North America. In contrast to B. edulis, B. rex-veris tends to fruit in clusters, and, as its common name suggests, appears in the spring. B. fibrillosus is edible but considered inferior in taste.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "The fruit bodies of Boletus edulis can grow singly or in small clusters of two or three specimens. The mushroom's habitat consists of areas dominated by pine (Pinus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), hemlock (Tsuga spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) trees, although other hosts include chestnut, chinquapin, beech, Keteleeria spp., Lithocarpus spp., and oak. In California, porcini have been collected in a variety of forests, such as coastal forests, dry interior oak forests and savannas and interior high-elevation montane mixed forests, to an altitude of 3,500 m (11,500 ft). In northwestern Spain, they are common in scrublands dominated by the rock rose species Cistus ladanifer and Halimium lasianthum. In the Midi region of south-west France, they are especially favoured and locally called cèpe de Bordeaux after the town from which they are traded to the north and abroad.\nBoletus edulis has a cosmopolitan distribution, concentrated in cool-temperate to subtropical regions. It is common in Europe—from northern Scandinavia, south to the extremities of Greece and Italy—and North America, where its southern range extends as far south as Mexico. It is well known from the Borgotaro area of Parma, Italy, and has PGI status there. The European distribution extends north to Scandinavia and south to southern Italy and Morocco. In North America, it can be found from May to October inland and August to January on the West Coast. In China, the mushroom can be found from the northeastern Heilongjiang to the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau and Tibet. It has been recorded growing under Pinus and Tsuga in Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal, as well as in the Indian forests of Arunachal Pradesh. In West Asia, the species has been reported from the northwest forests of Iran.",
    "Cultivation": "Some steps have been made towards cultivating Boletus edulis, including mycorrhization of rockrose shrubs enhanced by helper bacteria.",
    "Non-native introductions": "Boletus edulis grows in some areas where it is not believed to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where it is likely to have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and is believed to have been introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.",
    "Fruit body production": "Italian folklore holds that porcini sprout up at the time of the new moon; research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies. Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn (June to November in the UK), their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature. Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes, in what is known in some circles as a \"bolete year\". A 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat, corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study; removal of the litter layer on the forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production, but previous studies reported contradictory results. A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap (about 21 mm or 0.8 in) occurred when the relative air humidity was the greatest, and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the air humidity dropped below 40%. Factors most likely to inhibit the appearance of fruit bodies included prolonged drought, inadequate air and soil humidity, sudden decreases of night air temperatures, and the appearance of the first frost. Plots facing north tend to produce more mushrooms compared to equivalent plots facing south.",
    "Mycorrhizal associations": "Boletus edulis is mycorrhizal—it is in a mutualistic relationship with the roots of plants (hosts), in which the fungus exchanges nitrogen and other nutrients extracted from the environment for fixed carbon from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: in the case of the Chinese chestnut, the formation of mycorrhizae with B. edulis increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist water stress, and increases leaf succulence, leaf area, and water-holding ability. The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a hartig net.  The ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with the plant, effectively expanding the root system of the host plant to the furthest reaches of the symbiont fungi. Compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere; according to one 1995 estimate, there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera. Examples of mycorrhizal associates include Chinese red pine, Mexican weeping pine, Scots pine, Norway spruce, Coast Douglas-fir, mountain pine, and Virginia pine. The fungus has also been shown to associate with gum rockrose, a pioneer early stage shrub that is adapted for growth in degraded areas, such as burned forests. These and other rockrose species are ecologically important as fungal reservoirs, maintaining an inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi for trees that appear later in the forest regrowth cycle.\nThe mushroom has been noted to often co-occur with Amanita muscaria or A. rubescens, although it is unclear whether this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between B. edulis and Amanita excelsa on Pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.",
    "Heavy-metal contamination": "Boletus edulis is known to be able to tolerate and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal.",
    "Pests and predators": "The fruit bodies of B. edulis can be infected by the parasitic mould-like fungus Hypomyces chrysospermus, known as the bolete eater, which manifests itself as a white, yellow, or reddish-brown cottony layer over the surface of the mushroom. Some reported cases of stomach ache following consumption of dried porcini have been attributed to the presence of this mould on the fruit bodies. The mushroom is also used as a food source by several species of mushroom flies, as well as other insects and their larvae. An unidentified species of virus was reported to have infected specimens found in the Netherlands and in Italy; fruit bodies affected by the virus had relatively thick stems and small or no caps, leading to the name \"little-cap disease\".\nBoletus edulis is a food source for animals such as the banana slug (Ariolimax columbianus), the long-haired grass mouse, the red squirrel, and, as noted in one isolated report, the fox sparrow.",
    "Culinary uses": "Boletus edulis, as the species epithet edulis (Latin: edible) indicates, is an edible mushroom. Italian chef and restaurateur Antonio Carluccio described it as representing \"the wild mushroom par excellence\", and hailed it as the most rewarding of all fungi in the kitchen for its taste and versatility. Considered a choice edible, particularly in France, Germany, Poland and Italy, it was widely written about by the Roman writers Pliny the Elder and Martial, although ranked below the esteemed Amanita caesarea. When he was served suilli instead of boleti, the disgruntled Martial wrote: sunt tibi boleti; fungos ego sumo suillos (Ep. iii. 60)(\"You eat the choice boletus, I have mushrooms that swine grub up.\")\nThe flavour of porcini has been described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. The fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several studies have shown that the fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.\nPorcini are sold fresh in markets in summer and autumn in Europe and Russia, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and distributed worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed with butter, ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as cèpes à la Bordelaise, cèpe frits and cèpe aux tomates. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. In Thailand they are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads. Porcini can also be frozen, either while raw or after cooking in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste of porcini deteriorate noticeably after being frozen for four months. Blanching (or soaking and blanching) as a processing step before freezing can extend the freezer life to 12 months. They are also one of the few species sold commercially as pickled mushrooms.",
    "Dried": "Boletus edulis is well suited to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its resulting texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too can be used in subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables, apart from soybeans. Some of their protein is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.\nLike other boletes, porcini can be dried by being strung separately on twine and hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F) for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to 50 °C (122 °F) until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they must be kept in an airtight container. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiera (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.",
    "Commercial harvest": "A 1998 estimate suggested that the total annual worldwide consumption of Boletus edulis and closely related species (B. aereus, B. pinophilus, and B. reticulatus) was between 20,000 and 100,000 tons. Approximately 2,700 tonnes (3,000 tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as the official sales figures did not account for informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700 tonnes (8,500 tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80 per kilogram, although in New York in 1997 the wholesale price rose to more than $200 per kilogram due to scarcity.\nIn the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species Boletus edulis, B. aereus, B. aestivalis and B. pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro. Here these mushrooms have been collected for centuries and exported commercially. Owing to the globalisation of the mushroom trade most of the porcini commercially available in Italy or exported by Italy no longer originate there. Porcini and other mushrooms are also imported into Italy from various locations, especially China and eastern European countries; these are then often re-exported under the \"Italian porcini\" label.\nIn Italy the disconnect with local production has had an adverse effect on quality; for example in the 1990s some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which are rather similar in appearance and when dried are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically have a very bitter taste, which is imparted to the flavour of the porcini with which they are mixed.\nAfter the fall of the Iron Curtain and the subsequent reduction of economic and political barriers, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Porcini and other wild fungi from these countries are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B. edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control of the harvest has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.\nLike many other strictly mycorrhizal fungi, B. edulis has eluded cultivation attempts for years. The results of some studies suggest that unknown components of the soil microflora might be required for B. edulis to establish a mycorrhizal relationship with the host plant. Successful attempts at cultivating B. edulis have been made by Spanish scientists by mycorrhization of Cistus species, with Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria helping the mycorrhiza.",
    "Nutrition": "Boletus edulis mushrooms are 9% carbohydrates, 3% fat, and 7% protein (table). Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content can be affected by environmental temperature and relative humidity during growth and storage. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the high proportion of insoluble fibre in B. edulis.\nThe total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 3% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a % of total fatty acids) are: linoleic acid 42%, oleic acid 36%, palmitic acid 10%, and stearic acid 3%.\nA comparative study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content.\nB. edulis mushrooms are rich in the dietary minerals, sodium, iron, calcium, and magnesium, with amounts varying according to the mushroom component and to soil composition in the geographic region of China where they were sampled. They also have high content of B vitamins and tocopherols. B. edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium, a trace mineral, although the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low.",
    "Phytochemicals and research": "Boletus edulis fruit bodies contain diverse phytochemicals, including 500 mg of ergosterol per 100 g of dried mushroom, and ergothioneine. The fruit bodies contain numerous polyphenols, especially a high content of rosmarinic acid, and organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), and alkaloids.",
    "Aroma": "Aroma compounds giving B. edulis mushrooms their characteristic fragrance include some 100 components, such as esters and fatty acids. In a study of aroma compounds, 1-octen-3-one was the most prevalent chemical detected in raw mushrooms, with pyrazines having increased aroma effect and elevated content after drying.",
    "In human culture": "In 2023, with the signing of bill H.B. 92, Boletus edulis became the state mushroom of Utah.",

  "Boletus reticulatus": {
    "Introduction": "Boletus reticulatus (alternately known as Boletus aestivalis (Paulet) Fr.), and commonly referred to as the summer cep is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Boletus. It occurs in deciduous forests of Europe, where it forms a symbiotic mycorrhizal relationship with species of oak (Quercus). The fungus produces fruiting bodies in the summer months which are edible and popularly collected. The summer cep was formally described by Jacob Christian Schäffer as Boletus reticulatus in 1774, which took precedence over B. aestivalis as described by Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1793.",
    "Taxonomy": "German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer described the summer cep as Boletus reticulatus in 1774, in his series on fungi of Bavaria and the Palatinate, Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones.  French mycologist Jean-Jacques Paulet described it as Le grand Mousseux (Tubiporus aestivalis) in 1793, adding that it was delicious with chicken fricassee and could be found in the Bois de Boulogne in summer. the species name the species name is derived from the Latin aestas \"summer\". Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries followed Paulet, using Boletus aestivalis in 1838.\nThe two names have been used in literature for many years.\nBoletus reticulatus is classified in Boletus section Boletus, alongside close relatives such as B. aereus, B. edulis, and B. pinophilus. A genetic study of the four European species found that B. reticulatus was sister to B. aereus. More extensive testing of worldwide taxa revealed that B. reticulatus was most closely related to two lineages that had been classified as B. edulis from southern China and Korea/northern China respectively. The common ancestor of these three species was related to a lineage consisting of B. aereus and the genetically close B. mamorensis. Molecular analysis suggests that the B. aereus/mamorensis and B. reticulatus/Chinese B. \"edulis\" lineages diverged around 6 to 7 million years ago.\nThe British Mycological Society approved the name \"summer bolete\" for Boletus reticulatus.",
    "Description": "The summer cep's fruiting body is a mushroom with a swollen bulbous stem, and large convex cap. The cap is more or less round and usually up to 30 centimetres (12 in) in diameter. It bears a velvety brown, rust to chocolate cuticle which when dry often cracks to reveal the white flesh underneath, giving the appearance of a net.\nThe darker, more uniform shade and the velvety feel of the cap are a key feature distinguishing this species as is the vagueness or total absence of a white edge to the cap margin as seen in Boletus edulis. The tubes and pores of the hymenium are initially white, darkening with age to pale yellow and finally brown. The stipe is central, up to about 12 cm (4+3⁄4 in) tall, and has a strongly marked reticulated pattern with a variable white to brown colour.\nThe flesh is white and thick and remains firm if yellowish as the mushroom ages, and is often attacked by insect larvae. Its odour is pleasant.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The summer cep is found in woods throughout Europe, after hot and humid weather, from the start of summer until the end of autumn. It is particularly common in the south and west of France, as well as in Tosco-Emiliano Apennine in Italy. It is less host-specific than other porcini mushrooms. It occurs in Ukraine and Crimea, and Republic of Karelia, Karachay-Cherkessia, Krasnodar Krai, Tula Oblast, Moscow Oblast, and as far east as Primorsky Krai in Russia. Boletus reticulatus has been recovered from southern Africa, where it was likely introduced, growing under the Mexican species Pinus patula.",
    "Edibility": "The summer cep, like most ceps, is edible and useful in cooking. However, its flesh is somewhat less firm than other ceps. Based on analysis of fruit bodies collected in Portugal, there are 334 kilocalories per 100 gram of bolete (as dry weight).  The macronutrient composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 22.6 grams of protein, 55.1 grams of carbohydrates, and 2.6 grams of fat. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 91% water. B. reticulatus contains predominantly unsaturated fatty acids; mainly cis-linoleic acid, followed by cis-oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to high proportion of insoluble fibre in B. reticulatus. It also contains more tocopherol than other species of mushroom.",

  "Boletus rex-veris": {
    "Introduction": "Boletus rex-veris, commonly known as the spring king bolete, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Boletus found in western North America. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under pine trees, generally in May to June. It has a pinkish to brownish cap and its stem is often large and swollen, and the overall colour may have an orange-red tinge. As with other boletes, the size of the fruiting body is variable. Boletus rex-veris is edible, and may be preserved and cooked.\nFor many years, Boletus rex-veris was considered a subspecies or form of the porcini mushroom B. edulis.  In 2008, a taxonomic revision of western North American populations of this species was published, formally establishing it as a distinct species, Boletus rex-veris.  Phylogenetic analysis has shown B. rex-veris as a member of a clade, or closely related group, with B. fibrillosus, B. pinophilus, B. subcaerulescens, B. subalpinus, and B. regineus.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Boletus rex-veris is found under pines (Pinus ponderosa, P. contorta subsp. murrayana) and firs (Abies concolor and Abies species) at elevations of 3,000 to 7,000 feet (910 to 2,130 m). It is often buried under needle duff and fruits from May to June in California. In Oregon it fruits at lower elevations, and its range continues into Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia.",

  "Calocera viscosa": {
    "Introduction": "Calocera viscosa is a species of fungus in the family Dacrymycetaceae. In the United Kingdom, it has the recommended English name of yellow stagshorn. In North America it is variously called coral jelly fungus, jelly staghorn, yellow false coral, yellow tuning fork, and jelly antler.\nThe basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are small, gelatinous, bright golden yellow, and branched. Calocera viscosa grows on logs and dead wood of conifers. It is a common species throughout Europe and has also been recorded from North America, Asia, and Australia.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally described as Clavaria aurea by the German naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt in 1793, but the name is illegitimate since it had already been used for a different species. The species was legitimately described as Clavaria viscosa from Germany in 1794 by South African-born mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. It was transferred to the genus Calocera by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1827.\nA white fungus from Italy was described as Calocera cavarae in 1896, but later studies suggested that this was only an aberrant form of C. viscosa lacking yellow pigments.",
    "Description": "Calocera viscosa forms bright golden to orange-yellow (rarely white), firmly gelatinous fruit bodies up to 10 centimetres (4 in) tall, with a paler stem and coral-like branches. \nThe fruit bodies are too slight to be of culinary interest.",
    "Microscopic characters": "Hyphae lack clamp connections. The basidia are two-spored and typical of the Dacrymycetaceae. The spores are weakly allantoid (sausage-shaped), 8 to 12.5 by 3.5 to 4.5 μm, thin-walled, becoming tardily once-septate.",

  "Calycina citrina": {
    "Introduction": "Calycina citrina, commonly known as yellow fairy cups or lemon discos, is a species of fungus in the family Pezizellaceae. The fungus produces tiny yellow cups up to 3 mm (1⁄8 in) in diameter, often without stalks, that fruit in groups or dense clusters on decaying deciduous wood that has lost its bark. The widely distributed species is found in North Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Central and South America. Found in late summer and autumn, the fungus is fairly common, but is easily overlooked owing to its small size. There are several similar species that can in most cases be distinguished by differences in color, morphology, or substrate. Microscopically, C. citrina can be distinguished from these lookalikes by its elliptical spores, which have a central partition, and an oil drop at each end.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally described from Europe in 1789 by German naturalist August Batsch as Peziza citrina. Elias Fries sanctioned this name in the second volume of his Systema Mycologicum (1821). Jean Louis Émile Boudier transferred the species to Calycella in 1885. Another historical name for the fungus was derived from Johann Hedwig's 1789 Octospora citrina. Fries referred Hedwig's name to Helotium in 1846, and for several decades the fungus was known as either Calycella citrina or Helotium citrinum, depending on which generic concept an author accepted. In a 1974 publication, Richard P. Korf noted that the generic name Helotium competes with a basidiomycete genus of the same name, and under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the ascomycete version of the name had to be abandoned because the basidiomycete version was sanctioned by Fries in 1832, and thus had priority. He also pointed out that the generic name Calycella could not be used, as it is a synonym of an older name Calycina, which contains species that bear only a distant taxonomic relationship to Helotium citrinum. Accordingly, he formally transferred Helotium citrinum to Bisporella, to produce the new combination Bisporella citrina. Korf further noted that since Bisporella was published by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1884, it had priority over Boudier's 1885 Calycella which has since been treated as a synonym under Bisporella, but elsewhere Calycina is treated as distinct. Molecular studies in 2013 concluded Bisporella a synonym for Calycina and the species was renamed Calycina citrina.\nThe specific epithet citrina is derived from the Latin citrin, meaning \"lemon yellow\". Common names for the fungus include \"yellow fairy cups\", and the British Mycological Society-approved \"lemon disco\"; the name \"disco\" is short for Discomycetes, an older term for ascomycete species with disc- and cup-shaped fruit bodies. Samuel Frederick Gray called it the \"lemon funnel-stool\" in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants.",
    "Description": "Fruit bodies begin as spherical, closed globules, before expanding. The smooth, bright yellow fruit bodies are small—typically less than 3 mm (1⁄8 in) in diameter and up to 1 mm (1⁄32 in) high—and shallowly cup- or disc-shaped. The inner surface is smooth, and bright yellow, while the outer surface is a paler yellow. In mass, the spore color is white. The stalk is broad, pale yellow in color, and short to nearly absent; when present it is rarely more than 1 mm. The fruit bodies may be so numerous that their shapes are distorted by overcrowding. Fruit bodies that have dried are wrinkled and have a dull orangish-brown color. The fruit bodies have no distinctive taste nor odor, and are not edible.\nThe smooth spores are roughly elliptical, measuring 8–14 by 3–5 μm; in maturity they have one cross-wall, and oil drops at either end. The asci (spore-bearing cells) measure 100–135 by 7–10 μm. The paraphyses are shaped liked narrow cylinders with diameters up to 1.5 μm, and have tips that are rounded or somewhat club-shaped. β-Carotene is the predominant pigment responsible for the yellow color of the fruit body.",
    "Similar species": "There are several small yellow discomycetes with which C. citrina might be confused. Lookalikes include the acorn cup (Hymenoscyphus fructigenus) that grows on fallen acorns and hickory nuts. The green stain fungus (Chlorociboria aeruginascens) forms blue-green cups, and stains its wood substrate bluish-green. Lachnellula arida is up to 6 mm (1⁄4 in) in diameter, and has hairs around the edge of its cup, and its outer surface is covered with short brown hairs.\nFruit bodies of Bisporella sulfurina have a coloration similar to C. citrina, but they are smaller and grow in clusters on old, blackened, fungal stroma on wood. Phaeohelotium species appear similar, and Orbilia species produce smaller discs. Pithya and Chloroscypha grow on conifer foliage. Arachnopeziza cups have a fuzzy surface.\nOther lookalikes include Hymenoscyphus species, including H. calyculus, but these can be distinguished by their distinct stalks, and growth on smaller woody debris like sticks and twigs, rather than logs and stumps. Many other small, yellow discos have fringed or hairy margins to the discs, like Anthracobia melaloma; this latter species grows on or near moss, rather than wood. Chlorosplenium chlora is another small cup fungus resembling C. citrina. It has a bright yellow outer surface, but the hymenium becomes develops greenish tints in age. The common jellyspot fungus (Dacrymyces stillatus) is usually smaller but can approach the dimensions of C. citrina. Similar in color, its fruit bodies are usually blob-like rather than cup shaped. Another cup fungus that grows on dead beech wood is Neobulgaria pura, but its fruit bodies are larger, ranging from 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+5⁄8 in).\nAlso similar are Bisporella pallescens, Dacrymyces capitatus, Guepiniopsis alpina, and members of Octospora.",
    "Distribution": "Calycina citrina is saprobic, and so obtains nutrients by breaking down complex organic molecules into simpler ones. Fruit bodies are typically encountered growing in dense clusters on the surface of rotten wood (especially deciduous trees), particularly beech. They have also been found growing on the fruit bodies of the polypore fungus Daedaleopsis confragosa. In a study of the succession of fungi associated with the decay of a 120-year-old healthy beech tree uprooted by strong winds, C. citrina was found on the wood about three years after the fall. It appeared after early colonizers such as Quaternaria quaternata, Tubercularia vulgaris (the anamorph form of Nectria cinnabarina), and Bulgaria inquinans, and was followed by Stereum hirsutum and Nectria cinnabarina.",
    "Ecology": "The widespread fungus is known from North Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Central and South America, Australia, and New Zealand. It is one of the most common of the small discomycetes."

    "Description": "The pileus (cap) of C. californicus is 5–30 centimetres (2–12 in) wide, exceptionally 50 cm (20 in), and yellow-orange in color (although adhering leaf litter may cause a mottled color); it may become brownish with age. The hymenium is folded into decurrent ridges (false gills) and cross-veins, which deepen with age. The color of these ridges is usually similar to the cap but paler. The stipe (stem) is 2–10 cm (3⁄4–4 in) long and 1–4 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) wide, with coloration similar to the hymenium. The spores are creamy yellow, elliptical, and smooth.\nindividual specimens up to 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) are reported, making it the largest-known species of chanterelle.  Their unusual size is due in part to their capacity for indeterminate growth, making C. californicus specimens actively grow for far longer than most other mushrooms.",
    "Similar species": "Several other species of chanterelle may be found in western North America:\n\nC. cascadensis – bright yellow fading to white in center of cap, associated with conifers\nC. cibarius var. roseocanus – false gills tend to be as dark or darker than cap\nC. formosus – smaller size, narrower stem, associated with conifers\nC. subalbidus – whitish overall color\nAdditionally, Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, Chroogomphus tomentosus, and species in the genera Craterellus, Gomphus, Omphalotus, and Polyozellus may have a somewhat similar appearance to C. californicus. Omphalotus olivascens, the western jack-o'-lantern mushroom, is poisonous and has been mistaken for chanterelles.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Cantharellus californicus forms a mycorrhizal association with oaks, particularly coast live oak in the woodlands of Coastal California. It has also been found in association with interior live oak, California black oak, canyon live oak, tanoak, and possibly Pacific madrone and manzanita. C. californicus is a popular wild edible in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is most common between November and April.",
    "In culture": "It became the official state mushroom of California in 2024."

  "Cantharellus cibarius": {
    "Introduction": "Cantharellus cibarius (Latin: cantharellus, \"chanterelle\"; cibarius, \"culinary\") is the golden chanterelle, the type species of the chanterelle genus Cantharellus. It is also known as girolle (or girole).\nDespite its characteristic features, C. cibarius can be confused with species such as the poisonous Omphalotus illudens. The golden chanterelle is a commonly consumed and choice edible species.",
    "Taxonomy": "At one time, all yellow or golden chanterelles in North America had been classified as Cantharellus cibarius. Using DNA analysis, they have since been shown to be a group of related species known as the Cantharellus cibarius group or species complex, with C. cibarius sensu stricto restricted to Europe. In 1997, C. formosus (the Pacific golden chanterelle) and C. cibarius var. roseocanus were identified, followed by C. cascadensis in 2003 and C. californicus in 2008. In 2018, C. anzutake was identified, found in Japan and Korea.",
    "Description": "The mushroom is easy to detect and recognize in nature. The body is 3–15 centimetres (1–6 inches) wide and 5–10 cm (2–4 in) tall. The color varies from yellow to dark yellow. Red spots will appear on the cap of the mushroom if it is damaged. Chanterelles have a faint aroma and flavor of apricots. The spore print is yellowish.",
    "Similar species": "Cantharellus cibarius can resemble species such as the dangerously poisonous Omphalotus illudens (eastern jack-o'lantern) and Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca (the false chanterelle).",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The species grows in Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Basin, mainly in deciduous and coniferous forests and typically from June to December.",
    "Uses": "A commonly eaten and favored mushroom, the chanterelle is typically harvested from late summer to late fall in its European distribution.\nChanterelles are used in many culinary dishes, but watery specimens are more susceptible to rot. The mushrooms can be preserved by either drying or freezing. The use of an oven for drying is not recommended because it can make the mushroom bitter."

  "Cantharellus cinnabarinus": {
    "Introduction": "Cantharellus cinnabarinus, the red chanterelle, is a species of fungus. It is a member of the genus Cantharellus along with other chanterelles. Its distinctive red color is imparted by the carotenoid canthaxanthin. Widely distributed in eastern Northern America, it fruits in association with hardwood trees in the summer and fall.",
    "Etymology": "It is named after cinnabar, which has a similar red color.",
    "Description": "Cantharellus cinnabarinus is recognized by its distinctive flamingo-pink to bright orange and red colors (imparted by the carotenoid canthaxanthin) and the presence of false gills underneath the cap. The fruitbodies can grow up to 7 centimetres (2+3⁄4 in) across.\nIt resembles some other species of Cantharellus, but tends to be more small and slender. Its forked gills distinguish it from Hygrocybe.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Widely distributed in eastern Northern America, it fruits in association with hardwood trees. It can be found from June to October, mostly on the ground in broadleaf and mixed broadleaf/conifer forests. It usually occurs scattered or in small groups. It forms mycorrhizal associations with forest trees and shows preference for acidic soils.",
    "Uses": "It is considered edible and good."

  "Cerioporus squamosus": {
    "Introduction": "Cerioporus squamosus, synonym Polyporus squamosus, is a basidiomycete bracket fungus, with common names including dryad's saddle and pheasant's back mushroom. It has a widespread distribution, being found in Eurasia and North America. It causes a white rot in the heartwood of living and dead hardwood trees.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described scientifically by British botanist William Hudson in 1778, who named it Boletus squamosus. It was given its current name in 1886 by Lucien Quélet but is still widely known by the Elias Magnus Fries name Polyporus squamosus.",
    "Etymology": "Squamosus comes from the Latin squamosus meaning covered with scales or scaly, referring to the signature dark brown scales found on the mushroom's cap.\nThe name \"dryad's saddle\" refers to creatures in Greek mythology called dryads who could conceivably sit and rest on this mushroom, whereas the pheasant's back analogy derives from the pattern of colors on the bracket matching that of a pheasant's back.",
    "Description": "Dryad's saddle is an annual mushroom commonly found attached to dead logs and stumps or on living hardwood trees at one point with a thick stem. Generally, the fruit body is round and between 8–30 centimetres (3–12 inches) across – exceptionally 60 cm (24 in) – and up to 10 cm (4 in) thick. The body can be yellow to brown and has \"squamules\" or scales on its upper side. On the underside one can see the pores that are characteristic of the genus Cerioporus; they are made up of tubes packed together closely. The tubes are between 1 and 12 mm (1⁄16 and 1⁄2 in) long. The stalk is 3–12 cm (1–4+1⁄2 in) long and 1.5–3.5 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) thick. The mushroom's smell resembles that of watermelon rind.\nThe fruit body produces a white spore print. The spores are 11–15 x 4–5 μm and are long and smooth ellipsoids. They can be found alone, in clusters of two or three, or forming shelves. Young specimens are soft but toughen with age. It is particularly common on dead elm and is also found on living maple trees. The fruit bodies, or \"shelves\" can grow rapidly. One studied by pioneer botanist Sir William J. Hooker at Dalbeth, Scotland in 1810 grew to a circumference of 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) and a weight of 15.5 kg (34 lb) in four weeks.",
    "Similar species": "In Polyporus tuberaster, the cap is rounder and the stipe more central, with the scales only dark at the tip.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The species is common and widespread, being found over much of Europe (July–November) and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States (April–October). It is also found in Asia and Australia. It commonly fruits in the spring, occasionally during autumn, and rarely during other seasons. Many mushroom hunters stumble upon this substantially sized mushroom when looking for morels during the spring, as both have similar fruiting times.\nAs a white rot fungus, it plays an important role in woodland ecosystems by decomposing wood, usually elm or maple, but is occasionally a parasite on living trees. Other tree hosts include ash, beech, horse-chestnut, Persian walnut, lime, maple, plane, poplar, magnolia, and willow.",
    "Uses": "The species is edible when young and cooked. Specimens can become infested with maggots and become firm, rubbery and inedible as they mature. Cookbooks dealing with preparation generally recommend gathering these while young, slicing them into small pieces and cooking them over a low heat.\nSome people value the thick, stiff paper that can be made from this and many other mushrooms of the genus Cerioporus."

  "Cetraria islandica": {
    "Introduction": "Cetraria islandica, also known as true Iceland lichen or Iceland moss, is an Arctic-alpine lichen whose erect or upright, leaflike habit gives it the appearance of a moss, where its name likely comes from.",
    "Description": "It is often of a pale chestnut color, but varies considerably, being sometimes almost entirely grayish-white; and grows to a height of from 7.6 to 10.2 centimetres (3 to 4 inches), the branches being channeled into flattened lobes with fringed edges.",
    "Chemistry": "In commerce it is a light-gray harsh cartilaginous body, almost colorless, and tastes slightly bitter. It contains about 70% of lichenin or lichen-starch, a polymeric carbohydrate compound isomeric with common starch. It also yields a peculiar modification of chlorophyll (called thallochlor), fumaric acid, lichenostearic acid, and cetraric acid (which gives it the bitter taste). It also contains lichesterinic acid and protolichesterinic acids.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It grows abundantly in the mountainous regions of northern countries, and it is specially characteristic of the lava slopes and plains of the west and north of Iceland. It is found on the mountains of north Wales, northern England, Scotland and south-west Ireland.  In North America its range extends through Arctic regions, from Alaska to Newfoundland, and south in the Rocky Mountains to Colorado, and to the Appalachian Mountains of New England.",
    "Ecology": "Cetraria islandica is a known host to the lichenicolous fungus species Lichenopeltella cetrariicola, which is known from Europe and Iceland.",
    "Uses": "All parts of the lichen are edible. It may be dry in winter but can be soaked. Boiling reduces the bitterness. It can be added as a thickener to milk or grains or dried and stored.\nIt is not in great demand, and even in Iceland it is only occasionally used to make folk medicines and in a few traditional dishes. In earlier times, it was much more widely used in breads, porridges, soups, etc. It forms a nutritious and easily digested amylaceous food, being used in place of starch in some preparations of hot chocolate. Cetraric acid or cetrarin, a white micro-crystalline powder with a bitter taste, is readily soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in water and ether. It has been recommended for medicinal use by alternative medicine sites, in doses of 2 to 4 grains (0.1 to 0.25 grams), as a bitter tonic and aperient. It is traditionally used to relieve chest ailments, irritation of the oral and pharyngeal mucous membranes and to suppress dry cough."

  "Chlorociboria aeruginascens": {
    "Introduction": "Chlorociboria aeruginascens is a saprobic species of mushroom, commonly known as the blue stain, green elfcup or the green wood cup because of its characteristic small, green, saucer-shaped fruit bodies. The actual fruit bodies are infrequently seen, with the fungus usually observed through the green staining of wood it causes.",
    "Taxonomy": "The specific epithet is derived from the Latin roots aerug- (\"blue-green\") and ascens (\"becoming\"). Some authors have used a variant spelling of the specific epithet, aeruginescens.",
    "Description": "This species has apothecia (cup-shaped ascocarps) that are usually attached laterally, often less than 0.5 centimetres (1⁄4 in) in diameter, collapsing laterally and becoming rolled inwards when dry. The outer tissue layer of the apothecium, known as the ectal excipulum, has a delicate tomentose surface composed of hair-like, straight or sometimes coiled, smooth hyphae. The stipe is typically less than 3 mm long, with a central or eccentric attachment to the apothecia. The spores are roughly spindle-shaped (fusiform), smooth, and 5–8 by 0.7–2.8 μm. The spore print is white. Apothecia grow on bark-free wood, especially oak, part of which at least is stained greenish by the mycelium. The abundant paraphyses, which may be entwined, are 55–95 by 1.5–2 μm, filiform, and septate with an unswollen, unbent apex that often extends beyond the level of the asci tips.",
    "Similar species": "The species is distinguished from the closely related Chlorociboria aeruginosa by having smaller spores. Although some authors have in the past failed to recognize any appreciable differences between the two species, Ramamurthi and colleagues note that not only are the spore sizes different, but C. aeruginascens have smooth tomentum hyphae, in contrast with the roughened hyphae of C. aeruginosa. C. aeruginascens is inedible.",
    "\"Green oak\"": "This species contains a quinone pigment called xylindein, a dimeric naphthoquinone derivative, whose structure was determined by spectroscopic means in the 1960s and later confirmed by X-ray crystallography. It is this compound that is responsible for the characteristic bluish-green stain of wood infected by this species, used today in decorative woodworking such as Tunbridge ware and parquetry. The use of this wood, known as \"green oak\", goes back to 15th-century Italy, where it was used in intarsia panels made by Fra Giovanni da Veroni."

  "Chlorophyllum brunneum": {
    "Introduction": "Shaggy parasol is the common name for three closely related species of mushroom: Chlorophyllum rhacodes, C. olivieri and C. brunneum, found in North America, Europe and Southern Africa. C. brunneum is also found in Australia.",
    "Taxonomy": "Chlorophyllum rhacodes, C. olivieri and C. brunneum were formerly known as Macrolepiota rhacodes or Lepiota rhacodes, but the name was changed on the basis of molecular phylogenetic evidence demonstrating a closer relationship to Chlorophyllum molybdites than to Macrolepiota procera. The subspecies Macrolepiota rhacodes var. brunneum was also elevated to species status as Chlorophyllum brunneum. Chlorophyllum olivieri is a closely related species that is also eaten as the \"Shaggy Parasol\".\nMany reference works spell the epithet \"rachodes\" rather than \"rhacodes\". The spelling \"rachodes\" was used by Vittadini when he first published the species in 1835, but was erroneous as the Greek word rhakos 'piece of cloth' should be transcribed as rhacos. Index Fungorum keeps to the original author's spelling, \"rachodes\".",
    "Description": "The shaggy parasol is a large and conspicuous agaric, with thick brown scales and protuberances on its fleshy white cap. The gills and spore print are both white in colour. Its stipe is slender, but bulbous at the base, is coloured uniformly and bears no patterns. It is fleshy, and a reddish, or maroon discoloration occurs and a pungent odour is evolved when it is cut. The egg-shaped caps become wider and flatter as they mature.\nIn all three species, the cap reaches about 6 to 20 centimetres (2+1⁄4 to 7+3⁄4 in) in width and the stipe grows to 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) tall with a diameter up to 2 to 3 cm.",
    "Similar species": "The shaggy parasol is similar in appearance to the similarly edible parasol mushroom, Macrolepiota procera. The latter grows considerably larger however, and is more likely to be found in the open than C. rhacodes, which prefers more shade and dislikes open pastures and fields. Another distinguishing feature is that C. rhacodes lacks the brown bands that are on the stem of M. procera.",
    "Edibility": "The shaggy parasol is popularly praised as an edible mushroom. However, it contains toxins which can cause gastric upsets and some individuals show a strong allergic response to all Chlorophyllum species, including shaggy parasols.\nWhile Chlorophyllum rhacodes and C. olivieri are considered edible everywhere, C. brunneum is considered toxic in some European countries as it causes severe gastric upset, although no specific toxin has been identified.\nFurthermore, young shaggy parasols look identical to the poisonous Chlorophyllum molybdites (the mushroom that causes the most poisonings in North America yearly). Checking for a white spore print is essential as C. molybdites' print is green (older specimens having slightly green gills). As a result, this mushroom is not recommended for inexperienced hunters."
  },
  "Chlorophyllum molybdites": {
    "Introduction": "Chlorophyllum molybdites, commonly known as the green-spored parasol, green-gill parasol, false parasol, green-spored lepiota and vomiter, is a common species of mushroom found in temperate and subtropical meadows and lawns.\nThe species is poisonous and causes potentially serious vomiting and diarrhea. It is the most commonly consumed poisonous mushroom in North America, often being misidentified as edible species like Chlorophyllum rhacodes (the shaggy parasol) and Macrolepiota procera (parasol mushroom).",
    "Description": "The pileus (cap) ranges from 8 to 30 cm (3.1 to 12 in) in diameter, hemispherical and with a flattened top. The cap is whitish in colour with coarse brownish scales. The gills are free and white, usually turning dark and green with maturity. It is the only large mushroom that has a green spore print.  The stipe ranges from 5 to 30 cm (2.0 to 12 in) tall and bears a double-edged ring. Its stem lacks the snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the parasol mushroom. The flesh is thick, and though firm at first, softens with age. It is white, though the base of the foot can sporadically become reddish-brown to pale reddish-pink or almost orange when cut or crushed.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Chlorophyllum molybdites grows in meadows, lawns and parks across eastern North America, as well as temperate and subtropical regions around the world. Fruiting bodies generally appear after summer and autumn rains. It appears to have spread to other countries, with reports from Scotland, Australia, and Cyprus.\nChlorophyllum molybdites is sometimes called fairy ring mushroom since it often forms fairy rings.",
    "Toxicity": "Chlorophyllum molybdites is the most frequently eaten poisonous mushroom in North America. The symptoms, likely caused by the chemical compound molybdophyllysin, are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, with vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pains, often severe, occurring 1–3 hours after consumption. Although these poisonings can be severe, particularly in children, deaths from these mushrooms have been incredibly rare (and have mainly occurred in small children and dogs).Professor James Kimbrough writes:Chlorophyllum molybdites, the green-spored Morgan's Lepiota, is responsible for the greatest number of cases of mushroom poisonings in North America, and in Florida. This is probably due to the fact that it is easily confused with choice edible species such as Lepiota procera and L. rhacodes, and it is one of the most common mushrooms found on lawns and pastures throughout the country, with the exception of the Pacific Northwest. When eaten raw C. molybdites produce severe symptoms, including bloody stools, within a couple of hours. When cooked well, or parboiled and decanting the liquid before cooking, others eat and enjoy it. Eilers and Nelso (1974) found a heat-labile, high molecular weight protein which showed an adverse effect when given by intraperitoneal injection into laboratory animals.\nCases of poisoning from these mushrooms are also reported in Malaysia, where they are often mistaken for Termitomyces mushrooms that are found locally. It also might be confused for Coprinus comatus (shaggy mane)."

  "Chondrostereum purpureum": {
    "Introduction": "Chondrostereum purpureum is a fungal plant pathogen which causes silver leaf disease of trees. It attacks most species of the rose family Rosaceae, particularly the genus Prunus. The disease is progressive and often fatal. The common name is taken from the progressive silvering of leaves on affected branches. It is spread by airborne spores landing on freshly exposed sapwood. For this reason cherries and plums are pruned in summer, when spores are least likely to be present and when disease is visible. Silver leaf can also occur on poming fruits like apples and pears; plums are especially vulnerable.",
    "Taxonomy": "In the past the name Stereum purpureum Pers. was widely used for this fungus, but according to modern taxonomy it is only distantly related to Stereum, actually belonging to order Agaricales whereas Stereum is in order Russulales.",
    "Description": "It is a pathogen of various, mostly deciduous trees including species of Acer, Aesculus, Alnus, Betula, Crataegus, Fagus, Larix, Malus, Ostrya, Picea, Populus, Prunus, Salix, and Sorbus.\nAfter starting as just a crust on the wood, the fruiting structure develops undulating intergrowing brackets up to about 3 cm broad, which have a tough rubbery texture. The edges and fertile lower surfaces show a fairly vivid violet colour while the fungus is growing, and the upper surfaces have a grey aspect (sometimes with zonation and usually a lighter edge) and are covered with whitish hairs. After a week or two the fructification dries out, becomes brittle, and turns a drab brown or beige. Infected wood can be recognized because it is stained a darker tint.\nThe spores are rounded cylinders approximately 5–8 μm x 3–4 μm in size. The hyphal structure is monomitic with clamp connections.\nIt is often found on old stumps and dead wood, but can also be a serious parasite of living trees. As well as plum trees it attacks many other broad-leafed species (other Prunus, apple, pear, willow, poplar, maple, hornbeam, plane, oak, elm, lilac, and many others). Occasionally it also infects conifers (e.g. fir, spruce, and Thuja). Geographically it is roughly just as widespread as its hosts; it is common in woods, orchards and tree plantations in temperate climates.",
    "Similar species": "Amylostereum areolatum is considered to be similar, and usually has moss covering its cap. Phlebiopsis crassa does not form caps, while members of Trichaptum form a continuous surface covered by teeth or pores.",
    "As a human pathogen": "A single case report confirmed human infection with Chondrostereum purpureum in a non immunocompromised man who had been working with infected plant material. It was resolved by treating him with antifungal medication, but indicates potential for a broader host range for plant fungus than previously believed.",
    "Mycoherbicide": "Chondrostereum purpureum is commercially available as a method of combatting forest 'weed trees' such as aspens, beech, birches, maples, pin cherry, poplars, and other species. The fungus is applied directly to the weed trees in a nutrient paste which can be stored and handled conveniently.\nThe first regulatory approval was granted in 2001 to Myco-Forestis Corporation and targeted species \"including birch, pin-cherry, poplar/aspen, red maple, sugar maple, and speckled alder in the Boreal and Mixed forest regions of Canada, east of the Rocky Mountains\". It had not been reported as of 2001 to cause any diseases in coniferous tree species but apparently does.\nAccording to a 2007 regulatory decision of the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the use of this control method in paste form on Sitka spruce and red alder will only have a limited impact on non-target trees since the fungal spores are ubiquitous anyway and healthy trees are resistant to attack."

  "Cladonia rangiferina": {
    "Introduction": "Cladonia rangiferina, also known as reindeer cup lichen, reindeer lichen (cf. Sw. renlav) or grey reindeer lichen, is a light-coloured fruticose, cup lichen species in the family Cladoniaceae. It grows in both hot and cold climates in well-drained, open environments. Found primarily in areas of alpine tundra, it is extremely cold-hardy.\nOther common names include reindeer moss, deer moss, and caribou moss, but these names can be misleading since it is, though somewhat moss-like in appearance, not a moss. As the common names suggest, reindeer lichen is an important food for reindeer (caribou), and has economic importance as a result. Synonyms include Cladina rangiferina and Lichen rangiferinus.",
    "Taxonomy": "Cladonia rangiferina was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum; as was the custom at the time, he classified it in the eponymous genus, as Lichen rangiferinus. Friedrich Heinrich Wiggers transferred it to the genus Cladonia in 1780.",
    "Description": "Thalli are fruticose, and extensively branched, with each branch usually dividing into three or four (sometimes two); the thicker branches are typically 1–1.5 millimetres (1⁄32–1⁄16 inch) in diameter. The colour is greyish, whitish or brownish grey. C. rangiferina forms extensive mats up to 10 centimetres (4 in) tall. The branching is at a smaller angle than that of Cladonia portentosa. It lacks a well-defined cortex (a protective layer covering the thallus, analogous to the epidermis in plants), but rather, a loose layer of hyphae cover the photobionts. The photobiont associated with the reindeer lichen is Trebouxia irregularis. When fertile, the terminal branches often divide into short umbrella-shaped clusters; the apothecia that develop there are typically carried just below the actively growing branch tips and can be concealed within the cushion.\nReindeer lichen, like many lichens, is slow growing (3–11 millimetres or 1⁄8–3⁄8 inch per year) and may take decades to return once overgrazed, burned, trampled, or otherwise damaged.\nA similar-looking but distinct species, also known by the common name \"reindeer lichen\", is Cladonia portentosa.",
    "Chemistry": "The main secondary constituents of C. rangiferina are depside atranorin and depsidone fumarprotocetraric acid. A variety of other bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from C. rangiferina, including abietane, labdane, isopimarane, the abietane diterpenoids hanagokenols A and B, obtuanhydride, sugiol, 5,6-dehydrosugiol, montbretol, cis-communic acid, imbricatolic acid, 15-acetylimbricatoloic acid, junicedric acid, 7α-hydroxysandaracopimaric acid, β-resorylic acid, atronol, barbatic acid, homosekikaic acid, didymic acid and condidymic acid. Some of these compounds have mild inhibitory activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci.",
    "Resynthesis": "Resynthesis experiments have been conducted to study the early stages of lichen formation in Cladonia rangiferina. These experiments involve isolating and culturing the fungal and algal partners separately, then reuniting them under laboratory conditions to observe the process of lichenization. Through these studies, researchers have identified several key stages in the early development of the lichen thallus.\nThe first stage, known as the pre-contact stage, occurs around one day post co-inoculation. During this stage, no apparent fungal or algal growth is observed, and hyphal tips are not growing towards algal cells. By the eighth day post co-inoculation, the contact stage is reached. This stage is characterised by rich branching of fungal hyphae with short internodes. Hyphal tips grow towards algal cells, and some form swollen tips called appressoria upon contact. Hyphae can be observed growing around single algal cells or clusters, and mucilage is frequently present. The growth together stage is typically observed around 21 days post co-inoculation. At this point, coordinated growth between the fungus and alga becomes evident. Algal cells are integrated within a hyphal matrix, with hyphae emerging through algal colonies and forming networks within and between them.\nQuantitative measurements during these stages reveal several patterns. In compatible interactions, researchers observe significantly shorter hyphal internode lengths and more lateral branches compared to incompatible ones. The frequency of appressoria formation increases over time in compatible interactions. There is no significant reduction in algal cell diameter in compatible interactions, unlike in some incompatible pairings. These experiments highlight the specificity of the Cladonia rangiferina – Asterochloris glomerata/irregularis symbiosis. When paired with incompatible algae such as Coccomyxa peltigerae or Chloroidium ellipsoideum, C. rangiferina shows reduced growth and fewer symbiosis-specific morphological changes.\nThe resynthesis process in C. rangiferina appears to be slower compared to some other lichen species. Researchers have not observed a well-organised prethallus stage even after three months of co-cultivation. This may be due to specific environmental requirements or growth conditions needed for complete thallus formation in this species. These studies provide insights into the recognition mechanisms and early developmental processes involved in lichen formation. The observations support the concept of controlled parasitism in lichen symbiosis, where the fungal partner exhibits parasitic behavior, but in a controlled manner that allows for mutual benefit in the long term.",
    "Reproduction and life history": "Field studies show that C. rangiferina does, in fact, produce many small apothecia when conditions are favourable, but they are easy to miss. As the fertile tips begin to form the fruiting bodies, new sterile branches grow past them and become the visible top of the cushion, so the mature apothecia end up hidden just below the surface layer. This growth pattern lets the lichen keep expanding vegetatively while reproducing sexually.\nAt humid sites the species often becomes fertile across many branch tips at once, and the fertile tips frequently split into umbrella-like clusters that can bear several tiny discs (about 2 mm across). The study found that these apothecia release abundant, readily germinating ascospores, suggesting that sexual reproduction contributes to long-distance dispersal.",
    "Habitat": "Cladonia rangiferina often dominates the ground in boreal pine forests and open, low-alpine sites in a wide range of habitats, from humid, open forests, rocks and heaths. It grows on humus, or on soil over rock. It is mainly found in the taiga and the tundra. A specific biome in which this lichen is represented is the boreal forests of Canada.\nCladonia rangiferina has a strong tolerance for extreme stress such as freezing, dehydration, UV light and high salinity. Experiments discovered that the lichen will continue with respiration even after liquid-nitrogen immersion, severe drying, saturated salt exposure and temperatures down to -40°C.",
    "Ecology": "The fertility of Cladonia rangiferina varies with microclimate. In sites with good water relations and high air humidity, cushions commonly develop numerous apothecia and taller podetia (to roughly 12 cm), whereas in drier places fertile thalli are scarcer and podetia are shorter (about 4–6 cm). In a Finnish study of the growth rate of Cladonia rangiferina, it was found that the lichen grows from 3.9 to 4.4 mm per year, achieving the fastest growth rate in younger (less than 60 years), shadowy forests, and the slowest growth in an older (more than 180 years), thinned forest.\nCladonia rangiferina is a known host to the lichenicolous fungus species Lichenopeltella rangiferinae, which is named after C. rangiferina, Lichenoconium pyxidatae and Lichenopeltella uncialicola.",
    "Conservation": "In certain parts of its range, this lichen is an endangered species. For example, in the British Duchy of Cornwall it is protected under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.",
    "Uses": "The reindeer lichen is edible, but crunchy. It can be soaked with wood ashes to remove its bitterness, then added to milk or other dishes. It is a source of vitamin D.\nThis lichen can be used in the making of aquavit, and is sometimes used as decoration in glass windows. The lichen is used as a traditional remedy for removal of kidney stones by the Monpa in the alpine regions of the West Kameng district of Eastern Himalaya. The Inland Dena'ina used reindeer lichen for food by crushing the dry lichen and then boiling it or soaking it in hot water until it becomes soft. They eat it plain or, preferably, mixed with berries, fish eggs, or lard. The Inland Dena'ina also boil reindeer lichen and drink the juice as a medicine for diarrhea. Acids present in lichens mean their consumption may cause an upset stomach, especially if not well cooked.\nAccording to a study published in 2017, reindeer lichen was able to grow on burnt soil as soon as two years after a forest fire in Northern Sweden, indicating that artificial replanting of lichen could be a useful strategy for the restoration of reindeer pastures."

  "Cladonia stellaris": {
    "Introduction": "Cladonia stellaris (star-tipped cup lichen or star reindeer lichen) is an ecologically important species of cup lichen that forms continuous mats over large areas of the ground in boreal and arctic regions around the circumpolar north.  The species is a preferred food source of reindeer and caribou during the winter months, and it has an important role in regulating nutrient cycling and soil microbiological communities.  Like many other lichens, Cladonia stellaris is used by humans directly for its chemical properties, as many of the secondary metabolites are antimicrobial (e.g., Usnic acid), but it also has the unique distinction of being harvested and sold as 'fake trees' for model train displays. It is also used as a sound absorber in interior design. The fungal portion of Cladonia stellaris, known as a mycobiont, protects the lichen from lichenivores, superfluous solar radiation, and other kinds of stressors in their ecosystem.\nCladonia stellaris is described as mat-forming and fruticose (shrub-like) in appearance, and as terrestrial, terricolous, or epigeic, because it grows on the surface of bare soil or gravel.  Like most other lichens, Cladonia stellaris grows slowly, averaging less than 0.5 cm per year under good conditions.\nThis species differs from the similar Cladonia rangiferina and Cladonia arbuscula in that it forms much more distinct cushion-shaped patches, and appears to have denser branching when viewed from above.\nAfter an online vote sponsored by the Canadian Museum of Nature, the star-tipped cup lichen was unofficially crowned Canada’s national lichen."

  "Clitocybe nebularis": {
    "Introduction": "Clitocybe nebularis or Lepista nebularis, commonly known as the clouded agaric, cloudy clitocybe, or cloud funnel, is an abundant gilled fungus which appears both in conifer-dominated forests and broad-leaved woodland in Europe and North America. Appearing in Britain from mid to late autumn, it is edible, but may cause gastrointestinal issues.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described and named as Agaricus nebularis in 1789 by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch. It was later placed in the genus Clitocybe in 1871 by Paul Kummer as Clitocybe nebularis. After much consideration by many mycologists, over some years, when it was placed for periods in both Lepista, and Gymnopus, it was placed back in Clitocybe with the specific epithet, and 1871 accreditation it retains today.\nClitocybe nebularis var. alba Bataille (1911), differs only in having a milk white cap, and is very rare.",
    "Description": "The cap of the mushroom is 5–25 centimetres (2–10 in) in diameter, convex with an incurved margin, becoming plane to depressed in shape. Cap colours are generally greyish to light brownish-grey, and often covered in a whitish bloom when young. The surface of the cap is usually dry to moist, and radially fibrillose. The gills are pale, adnate to short-decurrent, close and usually forked. The stem measures 5–10 cm (2–3+7⁄8 in) long and 2–4 cm wide; it is stout, swollen towards the base, becomes hollow with age, and is easily broken. It is usually somewhat lighter than the cap. The flesh is white, and very thick. It usually has a foul-smelling odour, which has been described as slightly farinaceous to spicy, or rancid.\nThe spores are yellow and elliptical. The spore print is light yellowish.",
    "Similar species": "The species can resemble C. robusta which has a more solid white cap, C. irina which has a pinkish spore print, Ampulloclitocybe clavipes, and Harmajaea harperi.\nIt may also be confused with the poisonous Entoloma sinuatum both in Europe or North America, though this species has pink sinuate gills. It also resembles Leucopaxillus albissimus and Tricholoma saponaceum. Leucopaxillus giganteus is also similar in stature, but is whiter. Infundibulicybe geotropa has a pale brown cap.",
    "Ecology": "This species is host to the parasitic gilled mushroom Volvariella surrecta, which is found on older specimens.",
    "Edibility": "The species is edible but even a small portion can cause gastrointestinal disturbances for some people."

  "Clitocybe nuda": {
    "Introduction": "Collybia nuda, commonly known as the blewit or wood blewit and previously described as Lepista nuda and Clitocybe nuda, is a species of fungi. Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790, it was also known as Tricholoma nudum for many years. It is morphologically similar and related to the field blewit, Collybia personata; both mushrooms were reassigned to the genus Collybia in 2023.\nThe species is native to Europe and North America. It is found in both coniferous and deciduous woodlands. It has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France. It is a widely consumed edible mushroom.",
    "Taxonomy": "The French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described the wood blewit in his work Herbier de la France in 1790 as Agaricus nudus, reporting that it was common in the woods all year. He wrote of two varieties: one whose gills and cap are initially light violet and mature to burgundy, while the other has wine-coloured gills that intensify in colour with age. He added that the first variety was often confused with Cortinarius violaceus, though it has a \"nude\" cap and no spidery web veil unlike the other species.  English naturalist James Bolton gave it the name Agaricus bulbosa—the bulbous agaric—in his An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax in 1791. He noted that it was rare in the region, though had found some in Ovenden.\nGerman mycologist Paul Kummer placed it in the genus Tricholoma in 1871, the same year that English botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke placed it in Lepista. It was known by these names for many years, with some authors accepting Lepista and while others retained the wood blewit in Tricholoma. In 1969 Howard E. Bigelow and Alexander H. Smith reviewed Lepista and reclassified it as a subgenus of Clitocybe Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja has called for the sinking of Lepista into Clitocybe, with C. nebularis as the type species of the latter genus. Hence the wood blewit is classified as either Lepista nuda or Clitocybe nuda.\nA 2015 genetic study found that the genera Collybia and Lepista were closely related to the core clade of Clitocybe, but that all three were polyphyletic, with many members in lineages removed from other members of the same genus and instead more closely related to the other two. To complicate matters, the wood blewit is not closely related to the type species of Lepista, L. densifolia. Alvarado and colleagues declined to define the genera but proposed several options and highlighted the need for a wider analysis.\n\nThis species was reassigned to the genus Collybia in 2023.",
    "Names": "The species is commonly known as the wood blewit. Cooke called it the amethyst lepista, John Sibthorp called it the blue-gilled agaric in his 1794 work Flora Oxoniensis.",
    "Description": "This mushroom can range from lilac to purple-pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. Younger specimens are lighter with more convex caps, while mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap, ranging from 4–15 cm (1+1⁄2–6 in) in diameter. The gills are attached to the short, stout stem, which is about 2–6 cm (3⁄4–2+3⁄8 in) long and 1–2.5 cm wide, sometimes larger at the base. Wood blewits have a very distinctive odor, which has been likened by one author to that of frozen orange juice.\nWood blewits can be easily distinguished by their odor, as well as by their spore print, which is white to pale pink.",
    "Similar species": "Wood blewits can be confused with certain blue or purple species of the genus Cortinarius, including the uncommon C. camphoratus, many of which may be poisonous. Cortinarius mushrooms often have the remains of a veil under their caps and a ring-like impression on their stem. Cortinarius species produce a rusty brown spore print after several hours on white paper. Their brown spores often dust their stems and objects beneath them.\nThe species also resembles Collybia brunneocephala, Clitocybe tarda, Laccaria amethysteo-occidentalis, and Lepista subconnexa. It could be confused for members of the rare Texas genus Asproinocybe.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The wood blewit is found in Europe and North America and is becoming more common in Australia and New Zealand, where it appears to have been introduced. In Australia it has developed a relationship with some eucalyptus species and gorse; with an entirely different growth pattern and differs slightly in appearance to its European Lepista nuda cousins. \nIt is a saprotrophic species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December.\nSoil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit fairy ring under Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.\nThe form glaucocana is found in mountainous environs.",
    "Ecology": "In Australia, male satin bowerbirds collect blue objects to decorate their bowers with. A young male was reported to have collected wood blewits to this end near Braidwood in southern New South Wales.",
    "Edibility": "Wood blewits are good edible mushrooms.\nBlewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or sautéed in butter. They can also be cooked like tripe or as omelette filling, and also make good stewing mushrooms. They have a strong flavour, so they combine well with leeks or onions.\nWood blewits can be dried, or can be preserved in olive oil or white vinegar after blanching.\nThe wood blewit has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France. Cultivated wood blewits are said not to taste as good as wild wood blewits."

  "Coprinellus disseminatus": {
    "Introduction": "Coprinellus disseminatus, formerly known as Coprinus disseminatus and commonly known as the fairy inkcap, fairy bonnet, or trooping crumble cap, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. It can be found around dead wood in Europe and North America.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was given its current name in 1939 by Jakob Emanuel Lange.",
    "Description": "Coprinellus disseminatus grows to 4 centimetres (1+5⁄8 in) tall. The bell-shaped cap is tannish, becoming gray with age. The spore print is blackish-brown.\nThe species has about 143 sexes (mating types).",
    "Similar species": "It is difficult to distinguish from related species or lookalikes in Tulosesus.\nC. disseminatus does not dissolve into black ink (deliquesce) in maturity, unlike most other coprinoid mushrooms.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The species grows on dead wood such as rotting stumps and is widespread across Europe. It can be found in North America from June to November in the East and October to March near the West Coast.",
    "Uses": "The species is nonpoisonous. It can be eaten raw or cooked but does not preserve well. It is considered too small to be of value."
  },
  "Coprinellus micaceus": {
    "Introduction": "Coprinellus micaceus, commonly known as the mica cap, glistening inky cap, or shiny cap, is a common species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae.\nFormerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C. micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C. truncorum, and it has been suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.\nDepending on their stage of development, the tawny-brown mushroom caps may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to 3 cm (1+1⁄4 in). The caps, marked with fine radial or linear grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish stipes up to 10 cm (4 in) long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective mica-like cells. Although small and with thin flesh, the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the gills will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, spore-laden liquid—an enzymatic process called autodigestion or deliquescence. \nWith a cosmopolitan distribution, the saprobe typically produces clusters on or near rotting hardwood tree stumps or underground tree roots. The fruit bodies are edible before the gills blacken and dissolve; cooking stops the autodigestion process. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds.",
    "Taxonomy": "Coprinellus micaceus was illustrated in a woodcut by the 16th-century botanist Carolus Clusius in what is arguably the first published monograph on fungi, the 1601 Rariorum plantarum historia (History of rare plants), in an appendix, Clusius erroneously believed the species to be poisonous, and classified it as a genus of Fungi perniciales (harmful fungi). The species was first described scientifically by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard in 1786 as Agaricus micaceus in his work Herbier de la France. In 1801, Christian Hendrik Persoon grouped together all of the gilled fungi that auto-digested (deliquesced) during spore discharge into the section Coprinus of the genus Agaricus. Elias Magnus Fries later raised Persoon's section Coprinus to genus rank in his Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici, and the species became known as Coprinus micaceus. It was the type species of subsection Exannulati in section Micacei of the genus Coprinus, a grouping of related taxa with veils made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells usually formed in clusters) exclusively or with thin-filamentous connective hyphae intermixed.  Molecular studies published in the 1990s demonstrated that many of the coprinoid (Coprinus-like) mushrooms were in fact unrelated to each other. This culminated in a 2001 revision of the genus Coprinus, which was split into four genera; C. micaeus was transferred to Coprinellus.\nDue partly to their ready availability and the ease with which they may be grown in the laboratory, C. micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations of the structure of the hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C. micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet micaceus is derived from the Latin word mica, for \"crumb, grain of salt\" and the suffix -aceus, \"like, similar\"; the modern application of \"mica\" to a very different substance comes from the influence of micare, \"glitter\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \"shiny cap\", the \"mica cap\" or the \"glistening inky cap\", all in reference to the mealy particles found on the cap that glisten like mica.",
    "Description": "The cap is initially 1–2.5 cm (1⁄2–1 in) in diameter, oval to cylindrical, but expands to become campanulate (bell-shaped), sometimes with an umbo (a central nipple-like protrusion); finally it flattens somewhat, becoming convex. When expanded, the cap diameter reaches 0.8–5 cm (1⁄4–2 in) with the margin torn into rays and turned upwards slightly. The color is yellow-brown or tan often with a darker center, then pale yellow or buff from the margin inwards. The cap margin is prominently grooved almost all the way to the center; the grooves mark the positions of the longer gills on the underside of the cap. When young, the cap surface is covered with white or whitish shiny particles, remnants of the universal veil that covers immature specimens. The particles are loosely attached and easily washed away, so that older specimens are often smooth. Coprinellus micaceus is hygrophanous, meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration.\nThe gills are crowded together closely, and have an adnexed (narrow) attachment to the stipe. Initially white, they change color to dark brown then eventually black as the spores mature. Expansion of the cap causes the gills to split open down their median planes, tearing the cap margin into rays.  The process of spore discharge and autodigestion begin at the bottom of the gills before the upper parts of the gills have become completely blackened. The brittle stipe is hollow, and measures 3–10 cm (1+1⁄4–4 in) long by 2–5 mm (1⁄16–3⁄16 in) thick and is roughly the same diameter throughout the length of the stipe. It is generally white but may discolor to pale dirty cream from the base up. The stipe surface is at first velvety with a very fine whitish powder, but this eventually wears off, leaving it more or less smooth. Stipes may have a rudimentary ring at the base, another universal veil remnant. The spore print is dark brown or black. The flesh is thin, fragile, white in the stipe, and brownish in the cap. Its odor and taste are not distinctive. Individual fruit bodies take an average of five to seven days to fully mature.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "The spores of C. micaceus are reddish-brown or black, with dimensions of 7–10 by 4.5–6 μm. Generally, they are lentiform (shaped like a biconvex lens), but viewed from the side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly the shape of a miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a germ pore, a flattened area in the center of the spore surface through which a germ tube may emerge. The spore-bearing cells (the basidia) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7 μm. Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. Arthur Buller coined the term inaequihymeniiferous to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.\nCystidia that are located along the edge of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74 μm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are club-shaped or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155 μm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C. micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe) that are 60–100 by 5–10 μm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.\nThe globular cells that make up the mica-resembling scales on the cap are colorless, smooth-walled, and range in size from about 25–65 μm, although most are between 40 and 50 μm. Buller explained the \"glitter\" of these cells as follows: \"The sparkling of the meal-cells, as well as of the cystidia on the edges and faces of the gills, is simply due to light which strikes them from without and is refracted and reflected to the eye in the same manner as from the minute drops of water one so often sees at the tips of grass leaves on English lawns early in the morning after a dewy night.\"\nIn 1914, Michael Levine was the first to report successfully cultivating C. micaceus from spores in the laboratory. In his experiments, fruit bodies appeared roughly 40 to 60 days after initially inoculating the growth media (agar supplemented with soil, horse dung, or cornmeal) with spores. Like other coprinoid species, C. micaceus undergoes synchronous meiosis. The chromosomes are readily discernible with light microscopy, and all of the meiotic stages are well-defined. These features have made the species a useful tool in laboratory investigations of basidiomycete cytogenetics.  The chromosome number of C. micaceus is n=12.\nThe microscopic characteristics and cytogenetics of C. micaceus are well known, and it has been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in basidiomycetes.",
    "Similar species": "The edible Coprinellus bisporus is nearly identical but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black but do not dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinopsis atramentaria is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps on wood, from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and is said to be almost indistinguishable from C. micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C. truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C. micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C. truncorum, C. micaceus is browner in the center of the cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical. C. flocculosus is another similar species.",
    "Ecology, habitat and distribution": "Coprinellus micaceus is a saprotrophic species, deriving nutrients from dead and decomposing organic matter, and grows in and around stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on bark, particularly the secondary phloem, rather than the wood. In the scheme of the succession of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, C. micaceus is a late stage colonizer, and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached \"a friable softened consistency\". A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an endophyte, inhabiting the woody tissue of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms. The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots; it has also been noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments. In one instance it was discovered about 120 m (400 ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden gangways and props used to support the roof.\n\nFruit bodies are commonly found growing in dense clusters, but can also be found growing singly or in small clumps, especially in forested areas. In North America, C. micaceus is one of the first edible mushrooms to appear in the spring, and fruits from April to September. In Europe, it fruits from May to December. Although it can grow at any time of the year, it is more prevalent during the spring and fall, coinciding with the higher humidity resulting from spring and autumn rains. A study of air quality conducted in the city of Santiago de Compostela in the Iberian Peninsula, concluded that most \"Coprinus\" spores present in the atmosphere belonged to C. micaceus, and that the number of spores went up with increased humidity and rainfall, but decreased with greater temperatures. The species is known for reappearing with successive fruitings at the same location. In one case, a total of 38 lb (17.2 kg) of fresh mushrooms were collected from one elm stump in 10 successive crops over a spring and summer.\nCoprinellus micaceus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and has been collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; this suggests that the Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C. micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C. truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.",
    "Edibility": "Coprinellus micaceus is an edible species, and cooking inactivates the enzymes that cause autodigestion or deliquescence—a process that can begin as soon as one hour after collection. It is considered good for omelettes, and as a flavor for sauces, although it is \"a very delicate species easily spoiled by overcooking\". The flavor is so delicate that it is easy to overpower and hide with almost anything. The fungus also appeals to fruit flies of the genus Drosophila, who frequently use the fruit bodies as hosts for larvae production.\nA study of the mineral contents of various edible mushrooms found that C. micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34 species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Research into the natural product chemistry of Coprinellus micaceus has revealed the presence of several chemical compounds unique to the species. Micaceol is a sterol with \"modest\" antibacterial activity against the pathogens Corynebacterium xerosis and Staphylococcus aureus. The compound (Z,Z)-4-oxo-2,5-heptadienedioic acid has inhibitory activity against glutathione S-transferase, an enzyme that has been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells against chemotherapeutic agents, especially alkylating drugs. A 2003 study did not find any antibacterial activity in this species. A 1962 publication reported the presence of the biologically active indole compound tryptamine in C. micaceus, although the concentration was not determined. The fruit bodies additionally produce a variety of pigment compounds known as melanins—complex chemical polymers that contribute to the formation of soil humus after the fruit bodies have disintegrated. C. micaceus  has been found to be devoid of the toxin coprine, the disulfiram-mimicking chemical found in C. atramentaria that causes illness when consumed simultaneously with alcohol.",

  "Coprinopsis atramentaria": {
    "Introduction": "Coprinopsis atramentaria, commonly known as the alcohol inky cap, common ink cap, tippler's bane, or inky cap, is a species of fungus. It is the second best-known ink cap after Coprinus comatus, its former congener. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild.\nIt is a widespread and common throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas.  It can be eaten, but due to the presence of coprine within the mushroom, it is poisonous when consumed with alcohol, as it heightens the body's sensitivity to ethanol in a similar manner to the anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram.",
    "Taxonomy": "The common ink cap was first described by French naturalist Pierre Bulliard in 1786 as Agaricus atramentarius before being placed in the large genus Coprinus in 1838 by Elias Magnus Fries. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word atramentum \"ink\".\nThe genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that most species belonged in the family Psathyrellaceae, distinct from the type species that belonged to the Agaricaceae. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus Coprinopsis.\nThe term \"tippler's bane\" is derived from its ability to create acute sensitivity to alcohol, similar to disulfiram (Antabuse). Other common names include common ink cap and inky cap. The black liquid that this mushroom releases after being picked was once used as ink.",
    "Description": "Measuring 3–10 centimetres (1+1⁄4–4 in) in diameter, the greyish or brownish-grey cap is furrowed, initially bell-shaped, and later more convex, splitting at the margin. It melts from the outside in. The very crowded gills are free; they are white at first, then grey or pinkish and turn black and deliquesce.\nThe stipe measures 5–17 cm (2–6+3⁄4 in) high by 1–2 cm thick, is grey in colour, and lacks a ring. In young groups, the stems may be obscured by the caps. The spore print is black and the almond-shaped spores measure 8–11 by 5–6 μm. The flesh is thin and pale grey in colour.",
    "Similar species": "It can resemble several less common species in its genus.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Coprinopsis atramentaria occurs across the Northern Hemisphere, including Eurasia and North America, and has also been found in South Africa as well as Australia, where it has been recorded from such urban locations as the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and around Lake Torrens. \nLike many ink caps, it grows in tufts. It is commonly associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies have been known to push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.",
    "Toxicity and uses": "The mushrooms are considered edible when young, but consuming them within a few hours of alcohol results in disulfiram-like symptoms. This interaction has only been known since the early part of the 20th century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations, and tingling in limbs, arising five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5 mg/dl, and prominent at concentrations of 50–100 mg/dl. Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause myocardial infarction (heart attack). The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes. Rarely, a cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation on top of supraventricular tachycardia, may develop. Because of these effects, in some cases, the mushroom has been used to cure alcoholism.\nThe fungus contains a cyclopropylglutamine compound called coprine. Its active metabolite, 1-aminocyclopropanol, blocks the action of an enzyme, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which breaks down acetaldehyde in the body. Acetaldehyde is an intermediate metabolite of ethanol and is responsible for most symptoms of a hangover; its effect on autonomic β receptors is responsible for the vasomotor symptoms.\nTreatment involves reassuring the patient that the often frightening symptoms will pass, rehydration (fluid replacement) for fluid loss from vomiting, and monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias.\nLarge and prolonged doses of coprine were found to have gonadotoxic effects on rats and dogs in testing."

  "Coprinopsis lagopus": {
    "Introduction": "Coprinopsis lagopus, commonly known as the hare's foot inkcap, harefoot mushroom, or rabbit's foot inky cap, is a species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. It is commonly known as the harefoot mushroom due to the vague resemblance of the young fruit body to the paw of a white rabbit.\nIt is a delicate and short-lived fungus, the fruit bodies lasting only a few hours before dissolving into a black ink – a process called deliquescence.",
    "Taxonomy": "Until 2001, the species was known as Coprinus lagopus; advances in the understanding of phylogenetic relationships between the various coprinoid species led to a major reorganization of that genus.",
    "Description": "The fruit body size of Coprinopsis lagopus can vary tremendously. This fungus gives rise to very small fruit bodies (known as dwarf fruit-bodies), some of which are less than one-hundredth the size of the larger ones. In a series of experiments, Arthur Henry Reginald Buller grew spores on horse dung and noted a large range of size variation: the smallest specimen having a stem length of 1 mm and cap diameter of 0.75 mm, while the largest specimen had a stem length of 18.4 cm (7+1⁄4 in) and cap diameter of 2 cm. Buller noted that the dwarf fruit-bodies are fully functional, producing and liberating spores in a manner identical with normal ones. The great variation in size has led some authors to erroneously name the dwarf fruit-bodies as new species. For example, George Edward Massee considered the dwarfs to be a new species, Coprinus radiatus. In general, dwarf fruit-bodies have stem lengths from 1–10 mm tall and cap of 0.75–3 mm in diameter, while large specimens have stems that are 5–18.5 cm (2–7+1⁄4 in) tall and 2–5 mm wide, with cap diameters of 2–5 cm (3⁄4–2 in). The thickness of the stem in the larger specimens is typically 4–6 mm thick, up to 0.8 mm thick at the club-shaped or bulbous base.\nThe color of the cap surface is pale to very dark-brown at center beneath the whitish to silvery grey veil but becomes paler towards the margin. As the mushroom matures, the shape of the cap becomes more conical or convex, and finally flattens out, with edges curved upward. The veil is initially whitish, then turns to a silvery grey or grey-brown; it eventually splits up, becoming hairy (fibrillose). The gills are freely attached to the stem, very thin and crowded closely together. Initially, the color of the gills is white, then progresses to grayish-brown then to black as the spores mature. In maturity the gill edges dissolve (deliquesce) into a black liquid.\nThese mushrooms are evanescent, lasting only a few hours before dying; the autodigestive process is enhanced in humid environments. The stem is whitish in color, and is hollow, hairy (flocculose) over the whole surface but especially at lower parts, and becomes smooth (glabrous) with age. The spore print is violet-black.\nThe species is nonpoisonous. Its edibility is unknown but it is considered too small to be worthwhile.",
    "Microscopic features": "The spores have dimensions of 11–13 x 6–8 μm. They are ellipsoid or ovoid in shape, with a rounded base and apex, dark red-brown in color, and nonamyloid.\n\nThe cystidia found on the sides of the gills (pleurocystidia) are abundant in large fruit bodies, fewer in number in the smaller specimens. These cells are oval, rounded at the apex with a bulge in the middle, and contracted into a stalk at the base. The length of these cells is typically 100–130 μm, with a width of 35–45 μm. Before the cap expands, each cystidium completely branches an interlamellar space, with both ends attached to the gills, help together by clasping paraphyses. As the gill expands the cystidium breaks away from one gill and projects from the other gill. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) comes in two sizes; long basidia have dimensions of 40 × 8–10 μm, while the shorter basidia have dimensions of 23 × 8–10 μm. The basidia have four spores, which are attached by short sterigmata.",
    "Similar species": "The related species Coprinopsis lagopides (P. Karst) Redhead, Vilgalys & Montcalvo is similar in appearance, but more typically grows on a substrates like humus, or burnt or charred wood; it also tends to deliquesce more quickly and completely than C. lagopus. C. lagopides may be distinguished microscopically by its smaller spores (6–9 by 5–7 μm) that are roughly spherical or ovoid in shape, rather than elliptical as in C. lagopus.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Coprinopsis lagopus grows solitarily or in groups in soil as well as on wood chips, compost heaps, vegetable refuse, horse dung, or cattle dung from autumn to mid-winter. It has a widespread distribution throughout the world.",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Coprinopsis lagopus produces four weakly antibiotic sesquiterpene class compounds that are collectively named lagopodins. A total synthesis of lagopodin A was achieved in 2006.",
    "Genetics": "Coprinopis lagopus has been used as a model system for studying mushroom physiology and genetics for many decades.",

  "Coprinus comatus": {
    "Introduction": "Coprinus comatus, commonly known as the shaggy ink cap, lawyer's wig, or shaggy mane, is a species of fungus. The young fruit bodies first appear as white cylinders emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped caps open out. The white caps are covered with scales, the origin of its common names. The gills beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black. This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself in a matter of hours after being picked or depositing spores.\nThe mushroom is often seen growing about lawns, gravel roads, and waste areas in the Northern Hemisphere and more locally in the Southern Hemisphere. When young it is an excellent edible mushroom but it spoils quickly and resembles some poisonous species.",
    "Taxonomy": "The shaggy ink cap was first described by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller in 1780 as Agaricus comatus, before being given its current binomial name in 1797 by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. Its specific name derives from coma, or \"hair\", hence comatus, \"hairy\" or \"shaggy\".  Other common names include lawyer's wig, and shaggy mane.\nCoprinus comatus is the type species for the genus Coprinus. This genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the former species belonged in two families, the Agaricaceae and the Psathyrellaceae. Coprinus comatus is the best known of the true Coprinus.",
    "Description": "The shaggy ink cap is easily recognizable from its almost cylindrical cap which initially covers most of its stem. The cap ranges from 4–8 cm (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄4 in) in width and 6–20 cm (2+1⁄2–8 in) in height. It is mostly white with shaggy scales, which are more pale brown at the apex. \nThe free gills change rapidly from white to pink, then deliquesces (melts) into a black liquid filled with spores (hence the \"ink cap\" name). It is deliquescent. The white and fairly thick stipe measures 6–40 cm (2–16 in) high by 1–2.5 cm (1⁄2–1 in) in diameter and has a loose ring near the bottom. Microscopically, the mushroom lacks pleurocystidia. The spore print is black-brown and the spores measure 10–13 by 6.5–8 μm. The flesh is white and the taste mild.",
    "Similar species": "The mushroom can be confused with the poisonous Coprinopsis picacea (magpie fungus). In America, the 'vomiter' mushroom Chlorophyllum molybdites is responsible for most cases of mushroom poisoning due to its similarity with shaggy mane and other edible mushrooms. Coprinopsis atramentaria (the common ink cap) is similar, and contains coprine which can induce coprine poisoning, particularly when consumed with alcohol. Podaxis pistillaris is also similar.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "It grows in groups in grasslands and meadows in North America and Europe, from June through to November in the United Kingdom. It appears to have been introduced to Australia, New Zealand and Iceland.",
    "Ecology": "Coprinus comatus is a nematophagous fungus capable of killing and digesting the nematode species Panagrellus redivivus and Meloidogyne arenaria.",
    "Edibility": "It is a choice edible mushroom, especially when young, before the gills start to turn black. They should be prepared soon after being collected as the black areas quickly turn bitter. The taste is mild; cooking produces a large quantity of liquid. It can sometimes be used in mushroom soup with parasol mushroom. Large quantities, microwaved then frozen, can be used as the liquid component of risotto, replacing the usual chicken stock. While other mushrooms similar to Coprinus comatus contain coprine and are thus poisonous when consumed with alcohol, this specific species does not have that effect.",
    "In culture": "In Australia the species is sufficiently common to have been featured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post in 1981."

  "Crucibulum laeve": {
    "Introduction": "Crucibulum is a genus in the Nidulariaceae, a family of fungi whose fruiting bodies resemble tiny egg-filled bird's nests. Often called \"splash cups\", the fruiting bodies are adapted for spore dispersal by using the kinetic energy of falling drops of rain. The \"eggs\" inside the bird's nests (technically known as peridioles) are hard waxy shells containing spores, and tend to stick to whatever nearby herbage they land on, thus increasing the odds of being consumed and dispersed by herbivorous animals.\nMembers of this genus are saprobic, obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter, and are typically found growing on decayed wood and wood debris. The three known Crucibulum species (C. laeve, C. parvulum, and C. cyathiforme) are distinguished from other genera of the Nidulariaceae by their relatively simple funiculus – a cord of hyphae that connects the peridiole (the \"eggs\") to the exterior of the bird's nest.",
    "Taxonomy": "Bird's nest fungi were first mentioned by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over the next couple of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), erroneously suggested that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.\nThe structure and biology of the genus Crucibulum was better known by the mid-19th century, when the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne published a monograph on the bird's nest fungi. Subsequently, monographs were written in 1902 by Violet S. White (American species), Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1906, Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1924 (New Zealand species), and Harold J. Brodie in 1975.\nThe type species for the genus Crucibulum described by the Tulasne brothers was Crucibulum vulgare, an older synonym of the species known today as C. laeve. However, this naming choice was later deemed invalid by rules of fungal nomenclature; the first name validly applied to the species was C. laeve, use by De Candolle, who had based his species upon Nidularia laevis as it appeared in Bulliard's Histoire des Champignons de la France (Paris, 1791). Kambly and Lee published the first taxonomically valid description of the genus in 1936. In their 1844 monograph on the Nidulariaceae, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne used the name Crucibulum vulgare, and the species was known by this name until the International Commission on the Taxonomy of Fungi (ICTF) changed the starting-point date for the naming of fungi, and C. vulgare was deemed invalid. The etymology of the specific epithet is derived from the Latin laeve, meaning \"smooth\".",
    "Species": "Until the 1970s Crucibulum was thought to be monotypic, containing the single species C. laeve (formerly C. vulgaris). This was in part due to the stance that Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century, believing that the designation of new species was not justifiable due to the existence of intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity. In 1970–71, Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C. laeve sufficiently to justify naming them as new species.\n\n\nCrucibulum cyathiforme\nThe specific epithet of this species refers to the vase-like or Cyathus-like (obconic) form of the peridia. It differs from Crucibulum laeve in the shape and pink-color of its peridia, as well as its slightly or strongly curved spores (typically 6.5–8 x 11–17 μm). It was found growing on rotten wood and soil in Colombia by mycologist Gastón Guzmán.\n\n\nCrucibulum laeve\n\nCrucibulum laeve or the white-egg bird's nest have peridia that are 3–7 mm in diameter x 3–8 mm tall, cup-shaped, short and cylindrical with roughly parallel side walls. The tomentose exterior surface is tan to yellow when young and whiter in age. Young specimens have a coarsely tomentose epiphragm (membranous cover) that soon disappears.  The peridioles are 1–2 mm broad, tan to white in color, disc-shaped, and wrinkled when dry. This species grows on material like twigs, lignin-rich vegetable debris, wood chips, old matting, or manure.\nThe immature fruiting body of Crucibulum laeve (technically, the peridium), is roughly spherical in shape, but in maturity the base is narrowed slightly relative to the top, so that it appears like a cup, or crucible. The fruiting bodies are usually 5–8 mm tall and almost as wide at the mouth. When young, the mouth is enclosed by a thin membrane called an epiphragm, which is covered with surface hairs. As the fruiting body matures and the fruiting body expands, the epiphragm ruptures, exposing the internal contents. The wall of the fruiting body is made of a single uniform layer of closely interwoven hyphae (the threadlike filaments that form the mycelium) roughly 0.25–0.5 mm thick; this wall structure is in contrast to species from the bird's nest fungus genus Cyathus, which have a distinctly three-layered wall. Young species have a yellowish velvety cover of fine hairs, but this external surface becomes sloughed off and becomes smooth as the fruiting body matures; the color changes to brown, although some old weathered specimens may be bleached grey or dirty white. The inner surface of the fruiting body is smooth and shiny. The cups contain tiny pale ochraceous or white \"eggs,\" technically termed peridioles, usually 1–2 mm in diameter. In each peridiole is a spore-producing layer of tissue, the hymenium. This layer is largely composed of basidia (spore-producing cells) mixed with paraphyses (non-spore producing elements interspersed between basidia). Peridioles are covered by a thin membrane of loosely woven hyphae known as a tunica; separated from the light-colored tunica, the peridioles are black. The peridioles are attached to the inner wall of the peridium by a thin, elastic cord of mycelium, a funiculus, which can be extended at length when moist.\nCrucibulum laeve has spores that are elliptical, hyaline (translucent), and smooth, with dimensions of 7–10 by 4–6 μm.\n\n\nCrucibulum parvulum\nThis species, which is also known as the scanty bird's nest, is characterized by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3 mm wide at the mouth x 2–4 mm tall) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve. The peridia are obconic, thin-walled (150–180 μm at the lip, approximately 300 μm thick at the edge of the lip), tomentose on the outer side and smooth on the inner side, and taper to a narrow base. The peridioles range in width between 0.5 and 1.25 mm broad. Basidiospores have dimensions of 4–5 by 7–8 μm.",
    "Description": "Crucibulum species have light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, known as a peridium, that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, the size of the peridium may range from 2–4 mm tall by 1.5–3 mm wide at the mouth (for C. parvulum) to 5–10 mm tall by 5–8 mm wide (for C. laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue, in contrast to the three-layered peridium wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. \n\nYoung specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually four to six peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C. laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, the funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, translucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 μm by 5–8 μm. The spores of C. cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.\nBecause the basic fruiting body structure in all genera of the family Nidulariaceae is essentially similar, Crucibulum may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Cyathus, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus that may have the hairy ectoperidium worn off.  It distinguished from Nidula by the presence of a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.",
    "Peridiole structure": "Derived from the Greek word peridion, meaning \"small leather pouch\", the peridiole is the \"egg\" of the bird's nest. It is a mass of basidiospores and glebal tissue enclosed by a hard and waxy outer shell. In Crucibulum, the disc-shaped peridioles are light buff or white; the white colouring is due to a persistent layer of tissue surrounding the peridioles, called a tunica. Inside the peridiole is a spore-bearing tissue (the hymenium) that is made of spore-bearing cells (basidia), sterile (non-reproductive) structures, and spores.\nPeridioles are attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In Crucibulum species the peridioles are covered by a whitish tunica. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the purse is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5 mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the purse directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1 mm wide and about 2.5 mm long.",
    "Development": "The initial studies on the development of the fruiting bodies in Crucibulum were performed by the brothers Tulasne (1844), Sachs (1855), DeBary (1866), Eidam (1877), and Walker (1920). Collectively, these early researchers determined that basidiospores are produced on club-shaped basidia which line the internal cavity of the peridiole. Basidia typically have 4 spores, attached by a short projection (a sterigma); after being detached from the basidia the spores migrate towards the center of the peridiole concurrently with the collapse and gelatinization of the underlying tissues.",
    "Life cycle": "The life cycle of Crucibulum, which contains both haploid and diploid stages, is typical of the species of Basidiomycota that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: the vegetative stage for the spread of mycelia, and the reproductive stage for the establishment of spore-producing structures, the fruiting bodies.\n\nThe vegetative stage encompasses those phases of the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. Crucibulum laeve is saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.\nAfter a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruiting body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruiting bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruiting bodies are produced is long lasting and will continue to produce successive generations of fruiting bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.",
    "Spore dispersal": "Spores are dispersed when a peridiole is dislodged by raindrops or water dripping off an over-hanging leaf. The smooth inner walls of the fruiting body consistently form an angle of 70–75° with the horizontal; it has been demonstrated experimentally that the combined effect of the crucible shape and internal wall angle produce a good splash action.  The force of the falling water splashes out the peridiole, uncoiling and snapping the funiculus, the cord that connects it to the fruiting body. As the peridiole continues its flight, the funiculus extends to its full length. The sticky end of the funiculus may adhere to a leaf or a twig some distance away, and the peridiole may end up being wrapped around or hanging down the object to which the funiculus is stuck. The spores can germinate when the thick outer wall of the peridiole wears away, or the peridiole may be eaten by a herbivorous animal, and ultimately passed through its digestive system. This method of spore dispersal, first suggested by John Ray in the late 17th century, was tested experimentally by Martin (1927), and more thoroughly by Buller and Brodie in the 1940s.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Like other bird's nest fungi, Crucibulum species are saprobic and derive their nutrients from decomposing organic matter. They are typically found growing on wood and woody debris such as stems, twigs, wood chips, old nut shells, and old matting; they are sometimes found on \"dried manure cakes\". Brodie notes (of C. laeve) they are \"never\" found on soil or large logs. C. parvulum has been found on the roots and stems of old or dead dry land plants such as Juniperus horizontalis and Artemisia species.\nCrucibulum laeve, the most well-known species of Crucibulum, is a temperate-zone species with a circumpolar distribution. It has been collected in most European countries and the Canary Islands; in North America it has been found from Alaska to Mexico, while South American locations include Chile and Tierra del Fuego. It has also been found in Australia, Iceland, Japan, and New Zealand. C. parvulum has a primarily North American distribution, having been found in Alaska, southern Alberta badlands, the Canadian Rocky Mountains and in semi-deserts of Idaho; in 2004 it was collected in China. C. cyathiforme is only known from Colombia—where it was discovered growing at an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet (2,100 m)—and Armenia.",
    "Edibility": "Species in the family Nidulariaceae, including Crucibulum, are considered inedible, as they are \"not sufficiently large, fleshy, or odorous to be of interest to humans as food\". However, there have not been reports of poisonous alkaloids or other substances considered toxic to humans.",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Grown in liquid culture, Crucibulum laeve produces bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds are unique to this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated in the formation of cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus. The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.",

It is an after effect of attack by the pine bark beetle.\nThe fungus was originally described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1875 as Polyporus volvatus. Cornelius Lott Shear transferred it to the genus Cryptoporus in 1902.\nThe fruiting body is 1.5–8.5 centimetres (1⁄2–3+1⁄4 in) across and cream or tan in color. It is hollow inside and a hole is either torn by insects or a tear appears on the underside. There are 3–4 whitish pores per millimetre, hidden by the veil-like margin.

  "Daedaleopsis confragosa": {
    "Introduction": "Daedaleopsis confragosa, commonly known as the thin-walled maze polypore or the blushing bracket, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae. The species was first described from Europe in 1791 as a form of Boletus, and has undergone several changes of genus in its taxonomic history. It acquired its current name when Joseph Schröter transferred it to Daedaleopsis in 1888.\nA plant pathogen, it causes a white rot of injured hardwoods, especially willows. The fruit bodies are semicircular and tough, have a concentrically zoned brownish upper surface, and measure up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter. The whitish underside turns gray-brown as the fruit body ages, but bruises pink or red. It is found all year and is common in northern temperate woodlands of Eurasia and eastern North America.",
    "Taxonomy": "Daedaleopsis confragosa was first described scientifically under the name Boletus confragosus by English naturalist James Bolton, in his 1791 work An History of Fungusses, growing about Halifax. He reported finding specimens on old trees near Fixby Hall, and having specimens sent to him from Darlington. The species has been shuffled between several genera in its taxonomic history: Daedalea by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801; Trametes by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844; Polyporus by Paul Kummer in 1871; Stigila by Otto Kuntze in 1891; Lenzites by Patouillard in 1900; Agaricus by William Alphonso Murrill in 1905; and Ischnoderma by Ivan Zmitrovich in 2001. It was transferred to its current genus, Daedaleopsis, by German mycologist Joseph Schröter in 1888. D. confragosa is the type species of the genus Daedaleopsis.\nSeveral varieties have been described. L. Ljubarskii published var. bulliardi and var. rubecens in 1975. Both of these varieties were published invalidly are not considered to have independent taxonomic significance: variety rubescens is folded into synonymy with the main variety, while variety bulliardi is now considered synonymous with Trametes suaveolens. Variety tricolor, proposed by Appollinaris Semenovich Bondartsev and Rolf Singer in 1953, is now the independent species Daedaleopsis tricolor. Bondartsev described the form sibirica in 1953, but this is also no longer independent.\nThe polypore has acquired several vernacular names, including \"thin-maze flat polypore\", \"thin walled maze polypore\", \"blood-stained bracket\", and \"blushing bracket\". The latter name refers to its characteristic bruising reaction. James Bolton referred to it as the \"rugged boletus\".",
    "Description": "The shelflike or bracketlike fruit body is fan-shaped to semicircular, and typically measures 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in diameter, and up to 2 cm (0.8 in) thick.  Its upper surface is broadly convex to flat, dry, smooth to somewhat hairy, and usually has concentric zone lines. Its color ranges from reddish brown to brown to grayish, sometimes becoming blackish in maturity. The cap surface may have an umbo at the point of attachment to the substrate. Fruit bodies are leathery to corky when moist, but become hard and rigid when dry. The flesh is white to pinkish to brownish and tough. The underside of the fruit bodies features tiny pores measuring about 0.5–1.5 mm in diameter. They are white to tan to brown, but will develop pinkish or reddish tones if bruised. Pore shape is highly variable, ranging from circular to elongated, to mazelike, to gill-like. The tubes are up to 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long. The fruit body lacks a stalk, as the shelf attaches directly to the substrate. The fruit bodies have no distinctive odor and a slightly bitter taste.\nThe spore print is white; spores are cylindrical, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5 μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3 μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning that there are three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are thick walled, measuring 3–7 μm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new growth, can be either thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2–6 μm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2–5 μm.",
    "Similar species": "Cerrena unicolor (formerly Daedalea unicolor) is a common polypore species with a maze-like pore surface that can resemble D. confragosa. It can be distinguished by its thinner fruit bodies, a black line in the flesh, and the way that the tubes often break into irregular flattened teeth in maturity. Daedalea quercina, common on oak, has a larger fruit body up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter and 1–8 cm (0.4–3.1 in) thick, and its pore surface is more distinctively labyrinthine (maze-like). It causes a brown heart rot, where carbohydrates are removed from the inner heartwood, leaving brownish, oxidized lignin.",
    "Ecology and distribution": "Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that produces a decay of sapwood. It causes white rot, a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in the wounds of living trees. Its preferred host is willow, but it has also been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year-round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, and is one of the 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan.\nThe fruit bodies are popular among fungus-loving beetles. In a Russian study, 54 species from 16 families in the Coleoptera complex were recorded using the fungus; the most common were Cis comptus, Sillcacis affinis (Ciidae), Tritoma subbasalis, Dacne bipustulata (Erotylidae), Mycetophagus multipunctatus, M. piceus (Mycetophagidae), and Thymalus oblongus (Trogossitidae).",
    "Bioactive compounds": "The triterpenes 3α-carboxyacetoxyquercinic acid, 3α-carboxyacetoxy-24-methylene-23-oxolanost-8-en-26-oic acid, and 5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6,22-dien-3β-ol (ergosterol peroxide) have been isolated from D. confragosa. Lectins from D. confragosa, tested against rabbit and human erythrocytes, were determined to have anti-H serological specificity.\nAnalysis of the lipid and fatty acid composition revealed that D. confragosa contains 20.1% total lipids (mg/g dry weight), 32.9% neutral lipids, 53.8% phospholipid, and 13.3% glycolipids. An analysis of hydroxy fatty acid content showed that D. confragosa contains, as a percentage of total fatty acids, 0.02% 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid and 0.01% 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid.",
    "Uses": "The polypore is used in ornamental paper making, whereby the fruit bodies are pulped, pressed, and dried to produce sheets with unusual textures and colors.\nIt is inedible.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Entoloma abortivum": {
    "Introduction": "Entoloma abortivum, commonly known as the aborted entoloma or shrimp of the woods, is an mushroom in the Entolomataceae family of fungi. First named Clitopilus abortivus by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis, it was given its current name by the Dutch mycologist Marinus Anton Donk in 1949.\nThe grayish cap is up to 8 centimetres (3.1 in) wide. The stem is up to 9 cm long and 1.4 cm (1⁄2 in) thick. The smell is mealy and the spore print is pinkish.\nIt was once believed that the honey mushroom, Armillaria mellea, was parasitizing the Entoloma, but research has indicated that the inverse is true—the Entoloma parasitizes the honey mushroom.\nIn Mexico it is called Totlcoxcatl ('turkey wattle') due to its irregular shape. Caution should be used in identifying the species before eating, with similar species such as Entoloma sinuatum being poisonous."

    "Introduction": "Oakmoss (scientific name Evernia prunastri) is a species of lichen. It can be found in many mountainous temperate forests throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Oakmoss grows primarily on the trunk and branches of oak trees, but is also commonly found on the bark of other deciduous trees and conifers such as fir and pine. The thalli of oakmoss are short (3–4 cm in length) and bushy, and grow together on bark to form large clumps. Oakmoss thallus is flat and strap-like. They are also highly branched, resembling the form of antlers. The colour of oakmoss ranges from green to a greenish-white when dry, and dark olive-green to yellow-green when wet. The texture of the thalli is rough when dry and rubbery when wet. It is used extensively in modern perfumery.",
    "Commercial uses": "Oakmoss is commercially harvested in countries of South-Central Europe and usually exported to the Grasse region of France where its fragrant compounds are extracted as oakmoss absolutes and extracts. These raw materials are often used as perfume fixatives and form the base notes of many fragrances. They are also key components of Fougère and Chypre class perfumes. The lichen has a distinct and complex odour and can be described as woody, sharp and slightly sweet. Oakmoss growing on pines have a pronounced turpentine odor that is valued in certain perfume compositions.\nIn parts of Central Italy, oakmoss has been used as for biomonitoring the deposition of heavy metals at urban, rural, and industrial sites. Studies of bioaccumulation for zinc, lead, chromium, cadmium, and copper in lichen samples were performed five times at regular intervals between November 2000 and December 2001. As expected, the rural areas showed smaller impact of those five heavy metals when compared to urban and industrial areas.",
    "Health and safety information": "Oakmoss should be avoided by people with known skin sensitization issues. Its use in perfumes is now highly restricted by International Fragrance Association regulations, and many scents have been reformulated in recent years with other chemicals substituted for oakmoss.",
    "Conservation status": "Evernia prunastri is listed as critically endangered (CR) in Iceland, where it is found in only one location. As of April 2021, it has not been evaluated by the IUCN."

    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally described from England by botanist William Curtis in 1782 as Agaricus velutipes. It was transferred to the genus Flammulina by Rolf Singer in 1951.\nUntil recently, F. velutipes was considered to be conspecific with the Asian F. filiformis, cultivated for food as \"enokitake\" or \"golden needle mushroom\", but DNA sequencing shows that the two are distinct.",
    "Description": "F. velutipes grows up to 10 centimetres (4 in) tall and wide. The cap is light orange, darker toward the center. The stem fades to a darker color near the base. The flesh of the cap is yellow, while that of the stem is brown. The odour and flavour are pleasant. The spore print is white.",
    "Similar species": "It may resemble F. populicola and F. lupinicola. Marasmiellus dichrous and Xeromphalina tenuipes are also similar.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The species occurs throughout Europe (October to February) and in North America (through May in the east).\nVelvet shank is saprotrophic especially on dead or dying elm, as well as ash, beech and oak.",
    "Uses": "The fleshy caps can be sliced and cooked (ideally with the skin removed), or dried and ground into seasoning."

  "Fomes fomentarius": {
    "Introduction": "Fomes fomentarius (commonly known as the tinder fungus, false tinder fungus, hoof fungus, tinder conk, tinder polypore or ice man fungus) is a species of fungal plant pathogen found in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. The species produces very large polypore fruit bodies which are shaped like a horse's hoof and vary in colour from a silvery grey to almost black, though they are normally brown. It grows on the side of various species of tree, which it infects through broken bark, causing rot. The species typically continues to live on trees long after they have died, changing from a parasite to a decomposer.\nThough inedible, F. fomentarius has traditionally seen use as the main ingredient of amadou, a material used primarily as tinder, but also used to make clothing and other items. The 5,000-year-old Ötzi the Iceman carried four pieces of F. fomentarius, concluded to be for use as tinder. It also has medicinal and other uses.",
    "Taxonomy": "The first scientific description of the fungus appeared in the literature in the 1753 Species Plantarum by Carl Linnaeus; he called it Boletus fomentarius. The specific epithet fomentarius is from the Latin fomentum, referring to tinder. The species has been described as a member of numerous different genera. In 1783, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck named the species Agaricus fomentarius in his Encyclopédie Méthodique: Botanique. In 1818, Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer described Polyporus fomentarius in his Primitiae Florae Essequeboensis, and this name was sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in the 1821 publication of the first volume of his Systema Mycologicum. Fries later, in his 1849 Summa vegetabilium Scandinaviae, moved the species to the genus Fomes. Subsequent attempts to change the genus of the species have been unsuccessful; the species was named Placodes fomentarius by Lucien Quélet in 1886, Ochroporus fomentarius by Joseph Schröter in 1888 and Scindalma fomentarium by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In the twentieth century, Narcisse Théophile Patouillard named the species Ungulina fomentaria in 1900, and William Murrill twice reallocated the species; in 1903, he named it Elfvingia fomentaria and in 1914, he named it Elfvingiella fomentaria. In 1963, Shu Chün Teng named it Pyropolyporus fomentarius. These names are considered obligate synonyms; that is, different names for the same species based on a single description or specimen. In addition to the obligate synonyms, there are a number of taxonomic synonyms, whereby names have been described as separate species, but have come to be considered synonymous. The species is commonly known as the tinder fungus, hoof fungus, tinder polypore, ice man fungus or false tinder fungus.",
    "Description": "Fomes fomentarius has a fruit body of between 5 and 45 centimetres (2.0 and 17.7 in) across, 3 and 25 cm (1.2 and 9.8 in) wide and 2 and 25 cm (0.8 and 9.8 in) thick, which attaches broadly to the tree on which the fungus is growing. While typically shaped like a horse's hoof, it can also be more bracket-like with an umbonate attachment to the substrate. The species typically has broad, concentric ridges, with a blunt and rounded margin. The flesh is hard and fibrous, and a cinnamon brown colour. The upper surface is tough, bumpy, hard and woody, varying in colour, usually a light brown or grey. The margin is whitish during periods of growth. The hard crust is from 1 to 2 mm (0.04 to 0.08 in) thick, and covers the tough flesh. The underside has round pores of a cream colour when new, maturing to brown, though they darken when handled. The pores are circular, and there are 2–3 per millimetre. The tubes are 2 to 7 mm (0.08 to 0.28 in) long and a rusty brown colour.\nThe colouration and size of the fruit body can vary based on where the specimen has grown. Silvery-white, greyish and nearly black specimens have been known. The darkest fruit bodies were previously classified as Fomes nigricans, but this is now recognised as a synonym of Fomes fomentarius. The colour is typically lighter at lower latitudes and altitudes, as well as on fruit bodies in the Northern Hemisphere that grow on the south side of trees. However, studies have concluded that there is no reliable way to differentiate varieties; instead, the phenotypic differences can \"be attributed either to different ecotypes or to interactions between the genotype and its environment\".",
    "Microscopic features": "The spores are lemon-yellow in colour, and oblong-ellipsoid in shape. They measure 15–20 by 5–7 μm. The species has a trimitic hyphal structure (meaning that it has generative, skeletal and binding hyphae), with generative hyphae (hyphae that are relatively undifferentiated and can develop reproductive structures) with clamp connections.",
    "Similar species": "Fomes fomentarius can easily be confused with Phellinus igniarius, species from the genus Ganoderma and Fomitopsis pinicola. An easy way to differentiate F. fomentarius is by adding a drop of potassium hydroxide onto a small piece of the fruit body from the upper surface. The solution will turn a dark blood red if the specimen is F. fomentarius, due to the presence of the chemical fomentariol.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Fomes fomentarius has a circumboreal distribution, being found in both northern and southern Africa, throughout Asia and into eastern North America, and throughout Europe, and is frequently encountered. The optimal temperature for the species's growth is between 27 and 30 °C (81 and 86 °F) and the maximum is between 34 and 38 °C (93 and 100 °F). F. fomentarius typically grows alone, but multiple fruit bodies can sometimes be found upon the same host trunk. The species most typically grows upon hardwoods. In northern areas, it is most common on birch, while, in the south, beech is more typical. In the Mediterranean, oak is the typical host. The species has also been known to grow upon maple, cherry, hickory, lime tree, poplar, willow, alder, hornbeam, sycamore, and even, exceptionally, softwoods, such as conifers.",
    "Ecology": "Fomes fomentarius is a stem decay plant pathogen. The species' mycelium penetrates the wood of trees through damaged bark or broken branches, causing rot in the host. It can grow on the bark wound, or even directly onto the bark of older or dead trees. The decayed wood shows black lines in the lightly coloured decayed areas; these are known as pseudosclerotic layers or demarcation lines. The lines are caused by enzymes called phenoloxidases, converting either fungus or plant matter into melanin. The lines are not an absolute identifier, as they can also occur in plants infected by Kretzschmaria deusta and some Armillaria species. Despite beginning as a parasite, the species is able to survive for a time (hastening decomposition) on fallen or felled trees as a saprotrophic feeder, and typically lives there for years, until the log is completely destroyed. It is also capable of colonising and breaking down pollen grains, giving it a second food source which is particular high in nitrogen. Infected trees become very brittle, and cracks can occur in the affected tree due to wind. F. fomentarius is particularly adept at moving between cracks on the tree without interruption. However, in addition to the obviously infected damaged trees, F. fomentarius is known to be an endophyte, meaning that healthy trees which are not sporting F. fomentarius fruit bodies could still be infected.\nThe fruit bodies are perennial, surviving for up to thirty years. The strongest growth period is between early summer and autumn. The yearly growth always occurs on the bottom of the fungus, meaning that the lowest layer is the youngest. This occurs even if the host tree has been laid on the forest floor, which can happen because of the white rot induced by the fungus. This is a process known as positive gravitropism. Very large numbers of spores are produced, particularly in spring, with up to 887 million basidiospores an hour being produced by some fruit bodies. Spore production also takes place in autumn, though not nearly as heavily. The spores are released at comparatively low temperatures. In dry weather, the spores are visible as a white powder.",
    "Uses and importance": "The species is not considered edible; the flesh has an acrid taste, with a slightly fruity smell. The fungus has economic significance; it depreciates timber value as the parasitic infection advances. Fomes fomentarius infects trees through damaged bark.",
    "Amadou": "This species, as well as others such as Phellinus igniarius, can be used to make amadou, a material used as tinder, among other purposes. Amadou is produced from the flesh of the fungus fruit bodies. The young fruit bodies are soaked in water before being cut into strips, and are then beaten and stretched, separating the fibres. The resulting material is referred to as \"red amadou\". The addition of gunpowder or nitre produces an even more potent tinder. The flesh has further been used to produce clothing, including caps, gloves and breeches. Amadou was used medicinally by dentists, who used it to dry teeth, and surgeons, who used it as a styptic. It is still used today in fly fishing for drying flies. Other items of clothing and even picture frames and ornaments have been known to be made from the fungus in Europe, particularly Bohemia. The fungus is known to have been used as a firestarter in Hedeby, and it is known that the fungus was used as early as 3000 BCE. When found, the 5,000-year-old Ötzi the Iceman was carrying four pieces of F. fomentarius fruit body. Chemical tests led to the conclusion that he carried it for use as tinder.",

  "Fomitopsis betulina": {
    "Introduction": "Fomitopsis betulina (previously Piptoporus betulinus), commonly known as the birch polypore, birch bracket, or razor strop, is a common bracket fungus and, as the name suggests, grows almost exclusively on birch trees. The brackets burst out from the bark of the tree, and these fruit bodies can last for more than a year.",
    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was originally described by Jean Bulliard in 1788 as Boletus betulinus. It was transferred to the genus Piptoporus by Petter Karsten in 1881. Molecular phylogenetic studies suggested that the species was more closely related to Fomitopsis than to Piptoporus, and the fungus was reclassified to Fomitopsis in 2016.\nThe specific epithet betulina refers to the genus of the host plant (Betula). Common names for the fungus include birch bracket, birch polypore, and razorstrop fungus.",
    "Description": "The fruit bodies (basidiocarps) are pale, with a smooth greyish-brown top surface, while the creamy white  underside has hundreds of pores that contain the spores.  The fruit body has a rubbery texture, becoming corky with age. Wood decayed by the fungus, and cultures of its mycelium, often smell distinctly of green apples. The spores are cylindrical to ellipsoidal in shape, and measure 3–6 by 1.5–2 μm.\nFomitopsis betulina has a bipolar mating system where monokaryons or germinating spores can only mate and form a fertile dikaryon with an individual that possesses a different mating-type factor. There are at least 33 different mating-type factors within the British population of this fungus. These factors are all variants or alleles of a single gene, as opposed to the tetrapolar mating system of some other basidiomycete species, which involves two genes.",
    "Distribution, habitat and ecology": "Fomitopsis betulina is one of the most common species of brown rot fungi. The geographic distribution of F. betulina appears to be restricted to the Northern Hemisphere, including Northern America, Europe, and Asia. It is only found on birch trees, including Betula pendula, B. pubescens, B. papyrifera, and B. obscura. There is some doubt about the ability of isolates from the European continent, North America and the British Isles to interbreed.\nIt is a necrotrophic parasite on weakened birches, and will cause brown rot and eventually death, being one of the most common fungi visible on dead birches. It is likely that the birch bracket fungus becomes established in small wounds and broken branches and may lie dormant for years, compartmentalised into a small area by the tree's own defence mechanisms, until something occurs to weaken the tree. Fire, drought and suppression by other trees are common causes of such stress.\nIn most infections there is only one fungal individual present, but occasionally several individuals may be isolated from a single tree, and in these cases it is possible that the birch bracket fungus entered after something else killed the tree. These fungal \"individuals\" can sometimes be seen if a slice of brown-rotted birch wood is incubated in a plastic bag for several days. This allows the white mycelium of the fungus to grow out of the surface of the wood. If more than one individual dikaryon is present, lines of intraspecific antagonism form as the two individual mycelia interact and repel each other.\nThe fungus can harbor a large number of species of insects that depend on it for food and as breeding sites. In a large-scale study of over 2,600 fruit bodies collected in eastern Canada, 257 species of arthropods, including 172 insects and 59 mites, were found. The fungus is eaten by the caterpillars of the fungus moth Nemaxera betulinella. Old fruit bodies that have survived the winter are often colonized by the white to pale yellow fungus Hypocrea pulmonata.",
    "Uses": "The velvety cut surface of the fruit body was traditionally used as a strop for finishing the edges on razors, and as a mounting material for insect collections. It has also been used as tinder and anesthetic.\nIt is considered inedible, except potentially when young.",
    "Research on chemical constituents": "Fomitopsis betulina has been widely used in traditional medicines, and has been extensively researched for its phytochemistry and pharmacological activity. Phytochemicals include phenolic acids, indole compounds, sterols, and triterpenes, especially betulin and betulinic acid.\nAgaric acid, found in the fruit body of the fungus, is poisonous to the parasitic whipworm Trichuris trichiura. The fungus was carried by \"Ötzi the Iceman\" — the 5,300 year old mummy found in Tyrol — with speculation that the fungus may have been used as a laxative to expel whipworm."

    "Description": "Fomitopsis mounceae is typically fan-like in shape, with distinct bands usually brown or red in colour. It can have a resinous, sticky coating. As the conks age, they often become bumpy or warty. The cap is 8–25 centimetres (3–10 in) wide and 5–12 cm (2–4+1⁄2 in) thick at the base.\nThe underside of the conk is typically white or yellow in colour, with 3–6 round pores per millimetre. If broken open, the inside is yellowish, or sometimes woody and brown, with no distinct bands. It stains brown in KOH.\nThe spore print is whitish to cream.",
    "Similar species": "Fomitopsis ochracea is very similar but always lacks a red, orange or yellow zone; F. ochracea chars if burnt, while F. mounceae melts.

  "Fomitopsis pinicola": {
    "Introduction": "Fomitopsis pinicola, is a stem-decay fungus. Its conk (fruit body) is known as the red-belted conk or red-belted bracket. The species is common throughout temperate Eurasia. It is a decay fungus that serves as a small-scale disturbance agent in coastal rainforest ecosystems. It influences stand structure and succession in temperate rainforests. It performs essential nutrient cycling functions in forests. As well as a key producer of brown rot residues that are stable soil components in coniferous forest ecosystems.",
    "Taxonomy": "There is currently a splitting of F. pinicola occurring to isolate distinct species that have all previously been classified as F. pinicola. DNA analysis supports splitting F. pinicola into three groups- F. pinicola, F. mounceae, and F. schrenkii. Fomitopsis pinicola is found in Europe and Asia, F. mounceae is on the east coast of the US, west coast of the US and midwestern US, and F. schrenkii is found at higher elevations in the latitude of the Rocky Mountains, from Canada to central Mexico.",
    "Description": "The cap is hoof-shaped or triangular, and sometimes shelflike. It is hard and tough, and up to 30 cm or more across and 15 cm thick. Its surface is more or less smooth, at first orange-yellow with a white margin, later dark reddish to brown and then frequently with an orange margin. The pore surface is pale yellow to leather-brown, 3–4 pores per mm. It grows as thick shelves on live and dead coniferous or (less commonly) deciduous trees. The spores are pale yellow and smooth. The species also grows as a layer of tubes on the bottom of fallen wood.\nThe fruiting body of F. pinicola is called the conk. It is a woody, pileate fruiting body with pores lined with basidia on its underside. As in other polypores, the fruiting body is perennial with a new layer of pores produced each year on the bottom of the old pores. The pores are whitish when young and become somewhat brownish in age.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include Ganoderma lucidum, Laricifomes officinalis, and Heterobasidion annosum.",
    "Distribution, habitat and ecology": "The species is common throughout temperate Eurasia. It is common on softwood and hardwood trees.\nThis stem decay fungus is found on live conifer trees in southeast Alaska such as Western hemlock, Mountain hemlock, White spruce, Lutz spruce and Sitka spruce. The tree stem decay is caused by the fungus when it invades and colonizes the wood of living trees and decomposes the wood before the tree is dead. This brown rot fungus degrades only cellulose, leaving the other primary constituents of wood, lignin, as a considerably less dense but fairly stable residual structure that is suitable for excavation by woodpeckers.\nThis fungus is normally found on dead pines, but can be found on all conifers. It can also be observed growing on large stem wounds, broken tops, and dead tissue of live trees. In mature forests, these stem decay fungi cause enormous annual wood volume loss of Alaska's major tree species. Approximately one-third of the old-growth timber board-foot volume in Southeast Alaska is defective, largely due to decay from this type of fungus. Conversely, there is very little decay in young-growth stands without prevalent wounding from commercial thinning activities, wind damage, or animal feeding. By predisposing large old trees to bole breakage and windthrow, stem decays serve as important small-scale disturbance regimes in these temperate rainforest ecosystems where fire and other large-scale disturbances are uncommon.\nThis stem decay creates canopy gaps, influences stand structure and succession, increases biodiversity, and enhances wildlife habitat. The fungus also performs essential nutrient cycling functions in these forests by decomposing stems, branches, roots, and boles of dead trees. Cavities created by the fungus in standing trees provide crucial habitat for many wildlife species including bears, voles, squirrels, and a number of bird species. The lack of disturbance in these areas and longevity of individual trees allows ample time for this slow-growing decay fungus to cause significant decay. There is a growing interest in acquiring methods to promote earlier development of stem decays in second-growth stands to achieve wildlife and other non-timber objectives.",
    "Stem decay characteristics": "Most of the stem decay (heart rot) in mature forests that results from this fungus does not interfere with the normal growth and physiological processes of live trees since the vascular tissue is not affected. It is classified as a brown rot, which primarily degrades cellulose in tree stands. The early stage of wood decay appears as yellowish to brownish discoloration with the advanced stage appearing as a brown and crumbly breaking into cubical pieces. Wood impacted by this fungus may become more brittle and prone to breakage in high winds, and cannot be used for pulp production. This species requires exposed wood of wounds for entry, continuing their decay after the tree dies. On dead trees, the fungus general affects the sapwood and then progresses into heartwood.\nThe fruiting bodies of the fungus produce abundant basidiocarps and basidiospores which are generally dispersed in air currents and germinate upon contact with wood or other substrates, but the actual degradation of the wood is by the thread-like vegetative part of the fungus inside the trees. The fungus can occur anywhere on roots or the stem, but is most common low on the bole, where frequent wounds promote infection.",
    "Potential uses": "This mushroom is inedible due to its woody texture, but it is useful as tinder. It can potentially be prepared as a famine food through a laborious process.\nThe basidiocarps of the fungus have been reported to have medicinal uses in Asia. It has been reported that mushrooms have significant antioxidant activity."

  "Galerina marginata": {
    "Introduction": "Galerina marginata, known colloquially as funeral bell, deadly skullcap, autumn skullcap or deadly galerina, is a species of extremely poisonous mushroom-forming fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae of the order Agaricales. Before 2001, the species G. autumnalis, G. oregonensis, G. unicolor, and G. venenata were thought to be distinct from G. marginata due to differences in habitat and the viscidity of their caps, but phylogenetic analysis showed that they are all the same species.\nThe fruit bodies of the mushroom have brown to yellow-brown caps that fade in color when drying. The gills are brownish and give a rusty spore print. A well-defined membranous ring is typically seen on the stems of young specimens but often disappears with age. In older fruit bodies, the caps are flatter and the gills and stems browner. The species is a classic \"little brown mushroom\" – a catchall category that includes all small to medium-sized, indistinguishable brownish mushrooms – and thus can easily be misidentified.\nG. marginata is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. It is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, including Eurasia and North America, and has also been found in Australia. It contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings have been attributed to the species during the 20th century.",
    "Taxonomy": "What is now recognized as a single morphologically variable taxon named Galerina marginata was once split into five distinct species. Norwegian mycologist Gro Gulden and colleagues concluded that all five represented the same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA for various North American and European specimens in Galerina section Naucoriopsis. The results showed no genetic differences between G. marginata and G. autumnalis, G. oregonensis, G. unicolor, and G. venenata, thus reducing all these names to synonymy. The oldest of these names are Agaricus marginatus, described by August Batsch in 1789, and Agaricus unicolor, described by Martin Vahl in 1792. Agaricus autumnalis was described by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to Galerina by A. H. Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 worldwide monograph on that genus. In the same publication they also introduced the G. autumnalis varieties robusta and angusticystis. Another of the synonymous species, G. oregonensis, was first described in that monograph. Galerina venenata was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953. Since Agaricus marginatus is the oldest validly published name, it has priority according to the rules of botanical nomenclature.\n\nAnother species analysed in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, also could not be distinguished from G. marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G. pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.\nIn the fourth edition (1986) of Singer's comprehensive classification of the Agaricales, G. marginata is the type species of Galerina section Naucoriopsis, a subdivision first defined by French mycologist Robert Kühner in 1935. It includes small brown-spored mushrooms characterized by cap edges initially curved inwards, fruit bodies resembling Pholiota or Naucoria and thin-walled, obtuse or acute-ended pleurocystidia that are not rounded at the top. Within this section, G. autumnalis and G. oregonensis are in stirps Autumnalis, while G. unicolor, G. marginata, and G. venenata are in stirps Marginata. Autumnalis species are characterized by having a viscid to lubricous cap surface while Marginata species lack a gelatinous cap—the surface is moist, \"fatty-shining\", or matte when wet. However, as Gulden explains, this characteristic is highly variable: \"Viscidity is a notoriously difficult character to assess because it varies with the age of the fruitbody and the weather conditions during its development. Varying degrees of viscidity tend to be described differently and applied inconsistently by different persons applying terms such as lubricous, fatty, fatty-shiny, sticky, viscid, glutinous, or (somewhat) slimy.\"\nThe specific epithet marginata is derived from the Latin word for \"margin\" or \"edge\", while autumnalis means \"of the autumn\". Common names of the species include the \"marginate Pholiota\" (resulting from its synonymy with Pholiota marginata), \"funeral bell\", \"deadly skullcap\", and \"deadly Galerina\". G. autumnalis was known as the \"fall Galerina\" or the \"autumnal Galerina\", while G. venenata was the \"deadly lawn Galerina\".",
    "Description": "The cap ranges from 1 to 6 centimetres (1⁄2 to 2+1⁄4 in) in diameter. It starts convex, sometimes broadly conical, and has edges (margins) that are curved in against the gills. As the cap grows and expands, it becomes broadly convex and then flattened, sometimes developing a central elevation, or umbo, which may project prominently from the cap surface.\nBased on the collective descriptions of the five taxa now considered to be G. marginata, the texture of the surface shows significant variation. Smith and Singer give the following descriptions of surface texture: from \"viscid\" (G. autumnalis), to \"shining and viscid to lubricous when moist\" (G. oregonensis), to \"shining, lubricous to subviscid (particles of dirt adhere to surface) or merely moist, with a fatty appearance although not distinctly viscid\", to \"moist but not viscid\" (G. marginata). The cap surface remains smooth and changes colors with humidity (hygrophanous), pale to dark ochraceous tawny over the disc and yellow-ochraceous on the margin (at least when young), but fading to dull tan or darker when dry. When moist, the cap is somewhat transparent so that the outlines of the gills may be seen as striations. The flesh is pale brownish ochraceous to nearly white, thin and pliant, with an odor and taste varying from very slightly to strongly like flour (farinaceous).\n\nThe gills are typically narrow and crowded together, with a broadly adnate to nearly decurrent attachment to the stem and convex edges. They are a pallid brown when young, becoming tawny at maturity. Some short gills, called lamellulae, do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the longer gills. The stem ranges from 2 to 8 cm (3⁄4 to 3+1⁄8 in) long, 3–9 mm thick at the apex, and stays equal in width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward. Initially solid, it becomes hollow from the bottom up as it matures. The membranous ring is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap, but may be sloughed off and missing in older specimens. Its color is initially whitish or light brown, but usually appears a darker rusty-brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on it. Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish-brown to bistre base. The lower portion of the stem has a thin coating of pallid fibrils which eventually disappear and do not leave any scales. The spore print is rusty-brown.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "The spores measure 8–10 by 5–6 μm, and are slightly inequilateral in profile view, and egg-shaped in face view. Like all Galerina species, the spores have a plage, which has been described as resembling \"a slightly wrinkled plastic shrink-wrap covering over the distal end of the spore\". The spore surface is warty and full of wrinkles, with a smooth depression where the spore was once attached via the sterigmatum to the basidium (the spore-bearing cell). When in potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, the spores appear tawny or darker rusty-brown, with an apical callus. The basidia are four-spored (rarely with a very few two-spored ones), roughly cylindrical when producing spores, but with a slightly tapered base, and measure 21–29 by 5–8.4 μm.\nCystidia are cells of the fertile hymenium that do not produce spores. These sterile cells, which are structurally distinct from the basidia, are further classified according to their position. In G. marginata, the pleurocystidia (cystidia from the gill sides) are 46–60 by 9–12 μm, thin-walled, and hyaline in KOH, fusoid to ventricose in shape with wavy necks and blunt to subacute apices (3–6 μm diameter near apex). The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are similar in shape but often smaller than the pleurocystidia, abundant, with no club-shaped or abruptly tapering (mucronate) cells present. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.",
    "Similar species": "The deadly G. marginata may be mistaken for a few edible mushroom species such as Armillaria mellea, Psilocybe cyanescens and Kuehneromyces mutabilis. K. mutabilis (syn. Pholiota mutabilis) produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood, but may be distinguished by its stems bearing scales up to the level of the ring, and from growing in large clusters. However, the possibility of confusion is such that K. mutabilis is not recommended for consumption without expert and extremely certain identification. Microscopic examination shows smooth spores in Pholiota. K. mutabilis may be distinguished by the presence of scales on the stem below the ring, the larger cap, which may reach a diameter of 6 cm (2+3⁄8 in), and spicy or aromatic odor of the flesh. The related K. vernalis is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to G. marginata. Examination of microscopic characteristics is typically required to reliably distinguish between the two, revealing smooth spores with a germ pore.\nAnother potential edible lookalike is the \"velvet shank\", Flammulina velutipes. This species has gills that are white to pale yellow, a white spore print, and spores that are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–9 by 2.5–4 μm. A rough resemblance has also been noted with the edible Hypholoma capnoides, the 'magic' mushroom Psilocybe subaeruginosa, as well as Conocybe filaris, another poisonous amatoxin-containing species.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Galerina marginata is a saprobic fungus, obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It is known to have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and has been used as a model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.\nGalerina marginata is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran, continental Asia, and the Caucasus. In North America, it has been collected as far north as the boreal forest of Canada and subarctic and arctic habitats in Labrador, and south to Jalisco, Mexico. It is also found in Australia, and in Antarctica.",
    "Toxicity": "The toxins found in Galerina marginata are known as amatoxins. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide derivatives composed of an amino acid ring bridged by a sulfur atom and characterized by differences in their side groups; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal mushroom poisonings in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II, which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in gastrointestinal bleeding, a coma, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.\nGalerina marginata was shown in various studies to contain the amatoxins α-amanitin and γ-amanitin, first as G. venenata, then as G. marginata and G. autumnalis. The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was confirmed by growing the mycelium as a liquid culture (only trace amounts of β-amanitin were found). G. marginata is thought to be the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture. Both amanitins were quantified in G. autumnalis (1.5 mg/g dry weight) and G. marginata (1.1 mg/g dry weight). Later experiments confirmed the occurrence of γ-amanitin and β-amanitin in German specimens of G. autumnalis and G. marginata and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in the fruit bodies of G. unicolor. Although some mushroom field guides claim that the species (as G. autumnalis) also contains phallotoxins (however phallotoxins cannot be absorbed by humans), scientific evidence does not support this contention. A 2004 study determined that the amatoxin content of G. marginata varied from 78.17 to 243.61 μg/g of fresh weight. In this study, the amanitin amounts from certain Galerina specimens were higher than those from some Amanita phalloides, a European fungus generally considered as the richest in amanitins. The authors suggest that \"other parameters such as extrinsic factors (environmental conditions) and intrinsic factors (genetic properties) could contribute to the significant variance in amatoxin contents from different specimens.\" The lethal dose of amatoxins has been estimated to be about 0.1 mg/kg human body weight, or even lower. Based on this value, the ingestion of 10 G. marginata fruit bodies containing about 250 μg of amanitins per gram of fresh tissue could poison a child weighing approximately 20 kilograms (44 lb). However, a 20-year retrospective study of more than 2100 cases of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to ingestion of Galerina species. This low frequency may be attributed to the mushroom's nondescript appearance as a \"little brown mushroom\" leading to it being overlooked by collectors, and by the fact that 21% of amatoxin poisonings were caused by unidentified species.\nThe toxicity of certain Galerina species has been known for a century. In 1912, Charles Horton Peck reported a human poisoning case due to G. autumnalis. In 1954, a poisoning was caused by G. venenata. Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were reported in the literature. Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were attributed to G. marginata and G. unicolor, respectively. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to G. venenata, with five cases reacting positively to treatment; four poisonings were caused by G. autumnalis from Michigan and Kansas, in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified Galerina species from Ohio. Several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic Psilocybe stuntzii.",

  "Ganoderma applanatum": {
    "Introduction": "Ganoderma applanatum (the artist's bracket, artist's conk, artist's fungus or bear bread) is a bracket fungus with a cosmopolitan distribution. As its common names suggest, it can be used as a drawing medium.",
    "Description": "Ganoderma applanatum is parasitic and saprophytic, and grows as a mycelium within the wood of living and dead trees. It grows in single, scattered, or compound formations. It forms fruiting bodies that are 3–30 centimetres (1–12 inches) wide, 5–50 cm (2–19+1⁄2 in) long and 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) thick; exceptionally it may grow up to 75 centimetres (30 in) across. It is hard as leather and woody-textured. The upper surface of the fruiting body appears brown, covered with reddish-brown. The underside is white but stains brown.\nThe fruiting bodies are perennial, and may persist for multiple years, increasing in size and forming new layers of pores as they grow. These layers can be distinguished in a cross section or from observation of the concentric rings on the upper surface of the fruiting body. This allows the fruiting body's age to be determined using the same method as tree rings.\nBrown spores are released from the pores on the underside of the fruiting body. The spores are highly concentrated, and as many as 4.65 billion spores can be dispersed from a 10 cm (4 in) by 10 cm section of the conk within 24 hours. The tubes are 4–12 millimetres (1⁄8–1⁄2 in) deep and terminate in pores that are round with 4–6 per millimetre. The spore print is reddish brown.",
    "Similar species": "The similar Ganoderma brownii has thicker, darker flesh, often a yellow pore surface, and larger spores than G. applanatum. G. oregonense, G. lucidum, and Fomitopsis pinicola are also similar. Fomes fasciatus produces a white spore print.",
    "Ecology": "G. applanatum is a wood-decay fungus, causing a rot of heartwood in a variety of trees. It can also grow as a pathogen of live sapwood, particularly on older trees that are sufficiently wet. It is a common cause of decay and death of beech and poplar, and less often of several other tree genera, including alder, apple, elm, buckeye and horse chestnut, maple, oak, live oak, walnut, willow, western hemlock, Douglas fir, old or sick olive tree, and spruce. G. applanatum grows more often on dead trees than living ones.\nThere are anecdotal references of higher primates consuming this fungus for self-medication. In her book Gorillas in the Mist (1983), Dian Fossey wrote:\n\nStill another special food (for the gorillas) is bracket fungus (Ganoderma applanatum)... The shelflike projection is difficult to break free, so younger animals often have to wrap their arms and legs awkwardly around a trunk and content themselves by only gnawing at the delicacy. Older animals who succeed in breaking the fungus loose have been observed carrying it several hundred feet from its source, all the while guarding it possessively from more dominant individuals' attempts to take it away. Both the scarcity of the fungus and the gorillas' liking of it cause many intragroup squabbles, a number of which are settled by the silverback, who simply takes the item of contention for himself.\n\nThe midge Agathomyia wankowiczii lays its eggs on the fruiting body of the fungus, forming galls. Female forked fungus beetles, Bolitotherus cornutus lay their eggs on the surface of the fruiting bodies and the larvae live inside of the fruiting bodies of G. applanatum and a few other bracket fungi. Meanwhile, the fly Hirtodrosophila mycetophaga courts and mates entirely on the underside of dark fungi.",
    "Uses": "A peculiarity of this fungus lies in its use as a drawing medium for artists. When the fresh white pore surface is rubbed or scratched with a sharp implement, dark brown tissue under the pores is revealed, resulting in visible lines and shading that become permanent once the fungus is dried. This practice is what gives G. applanatum its common name.\nG. applanatum is a medicinal farming crop that is used as a flavor enhancer in Asian cuisine. G. applanatum is non-digestible in its raw form due to its toughness. Hot herbal soups, or fermentation in lemon acid with onion is a common use for cooking with G. applanatum slices as an umami flavor enhancer in fermented foods. G. applanatum can also be used in tea.\nG. applanatum has been used to produce amadou, although Fomes fomentarius is most commonly associated with its production. Amadou is a leathery, easily flammable material that is produced from different polypores, but can also be consist of similar material. Amadou generally has three areas of use: fire making, medicinal, and clothing, however, it is mostly associated with fire making.",
    "Medicinal uses": "Medicinal uses of G. applanatum have been extensive over thousands of years. In Chinese medicine, the fungus has been used to treat rheumatic tuberculosis and esophageal carcinoma. It has also been used more commonly to resolve indigestion, relieve pain and reduce phlegm. Further studies have shown that its medicinal qualities also include anti-tumor, anti-oxidation and as a regulator for body immunity.\nG. applanatum is known in Japan as kofuki-saru-no-koshikake (コフキサルノコシカケ), literally meaning \"powder-covered monkey's bench\", and in China as shu-she-ling-zhi (树舌灵芝), where it has long been used in traditional medicines. Studies have shown G. applanatum contains compounds with potent anti-tumor, antibacterial anti-fibrotic properties.\nG. applanatum is generally studied from three angles: medicinal, phytopathological, and biotechnological. Medicinal fungi such as G. applanatum are of special interest due to their antibiotic properties. Methanol extracts from G. applanatum have shown that the fatty acids present, such as palmitic acid, show antibacterial properties. Compared to synthetic antibiotics these compounds extracted from G. applanatum lack problems of drug resistance and side effects."

  "Ganoderma curtisii": {
    "Introduction": "Ganoderma curtisii is a wood-decaying polypore found in eastern North America.",
    "Taxonomy": "The name was originally established by Miles Berkeley in 1849 as Polyporus curtisii, and later transferred to the genus Ganoderma by William Alphonso Murrill in 1908. This species is tentative and is a subject of debate as to its viability as a distinct species from North American specimens described as G. lucidum (G. sessile), which is much more widely distributed throughout the US. There is also debate about the identities of several species that resemble G. lucidum and G. tsugae.\nOne reason for an alleged synonymy between G. sessile and G. curtisii is overlap in habitat, decaying hardwoods. According to Volk, Gilbertson and Ryvarden, authors of North American Polypores, it is not considered a separate species from G. lucidum. Bessette et al., authors of Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States, echo this and list it as a synonym to G. lucidum. Paul Stamets considers G. lucidum and G. curtisii to both be members of a tight-knit species complex.\nHowever, several recent molecular studies have shown Ganoderma curtisii to be genetically distinct from G. lucidum, calling into doubt the synonymy of the two species and supporting previous mycologists' opinion that it is a distinct species. The same studies support the idea that G. lucidum sensu stricto is actually absent from the North American continent and that the mushroom widely called G. lucidum in North America is instead G. sessile, a member of the Ganoderma resinaceum complex, with G. curtisii as a separate species.",
    "Description": "This polypore bears a marked resemblance to G. lucidum and generally has a stipe, sometimes lacking the characteristic red to purple varnished appearance that G. lucidum possesses. The flesh is spongy in pore tissue and firm in the stipe. The pores bruise brown when damaged.\nIts habitat of choice is decaying stumps and roots of hardwoods, which aligns perfectly with that of G. sessile.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The species is primarily found in the Southeastern United States. Craig and Levetin claim to have observed it in Oklahoma."

  "Ganoderma oregonense": {
    "Introduction": "Ganoderma oregonense (also known as the west-coast reishi, western varnished conk, lacquer fungus, and/or American ling-chi) is a species of bracket fungus that causes root and butt white rot in conifers in northwestern coastal North America.",
    "Taxonomy": "This species was originally described by W. A. Murrill as:\n\nPileus reniform, corky, rigid, convex above, plane below, 10 x 17 x 5 cm; surface glabrous, thinly encrusted, smooth, laccate, very lustrous, bay to black, with a deep groove near the margin, which is cream-colored, rounded, smooth, entire, finely tomentose; context punky, white to slightly discolored, homogeneous, with white lines of mycelium near the stipe, 2-3.5 cm. thick; tubes annual, 1 cm. long, avellaneous within, mouths circular to angular, 3 to a mm., edges thin, entire, white to avellaneous; stipe lateral, very thick, short, subcylindric, 2-4 cm long, 3-6 cm. thick, expanding into the pileus, which it resembles in color, surface, and context.",
    "Description": "Western varnished conk has a shiny brown-red-orange and sometimes cream-colored upper surface (often appearing as a color gradient), and white- or cream-colored pores. It can be shaped like a kidney or a fan or a hoof, or like a plate or stack of plates jammed into the side of a log. It fruits annually (rather than perennially), and usually shows up in the fall. They can grow up to 10–50 centimetres (4–19+1⁄2 in) wide, sometimes with a stem 2.5–10 cm (1–4 in) long and 0.5–4 cm (1⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) thick.",
    "Similar species": "G. oregonense is very similar to Ganoderma tsugae, but G. tsugae is associated with east coast Tsuga (hemlock) rather than west coast conifer. Its been speculated that G. oregonense and G. tsugae might actually be one species. Additionally, G. polychromum usually grows on the ground.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It can be found in northwestern coastal North America, including California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska. It can be found year-round but is freshest from July to November.\nTrees inoculated with G. oregonense end up with spongy, soft insides. It prefers dead red fir but will also accept dead or alive Douglas fir, spruce, hemlock, and pine. When this reishi is found on living trees it is usually consequent to tree wounds, such as bear marks.",

    "Habitat": "In contrast to Ganoderma lucidum, to which it is closely related and which it closely resembles, G. tsugae tends to grow on conifers, especially hemlocks.",
    "Uses": "Like G. lucidum, G. tsugae is non-poisonous but generally considered inedible, because of its solid woody nature; however, teas and extracts made from its fruiting bodies supposedly allow medicinal use of the compounds it contains, although this is controversial within the scientific community. A hot water extraction or tea can be very effective for extracting the polysaccharides; however, an alcohol or alcohol/glycerin extraction method is more effective for the triterpenoids.\nThe fresh, soft growth of the \"lip\" of G. tsugae can be sautéed and prepared much like other edible mushrooms. While in this nascent stage it is not woody, it can still be tough and chewy.",
    "Medicinal": "Like G. lucidum, G. tsugae is purported to have medicinal properties including use for dressing a skin wound. Though phylogenetic analysis has begun to better differentiate between many closely related species of Ganoderma; there is still disagreement as to which have the most medicinal properties. Natural and artificial variations (e.g. growing conditions and preparation) can also effect the species' medicinal value.\nStudies in mice have shown that G. tsugae shows several potential medicinal benefits including anti-tumor activity through some of the active polysaccharides found in G. tsugae. G. tsugae has also been shown to significantly promote wound healing in mice as well as markedly increase the proliferation and migration of fibroblast cells in culture.\n\n\nReferences"

The stipe is the same color as the cap, often dusted with rusty-brown spores, fibrillose, measuring 3–9 by 3–10 mm thick, equal to enlarged near the base. The stipe often has greenish stains near the base.  The taste is bitter.\nThe spores are bright rusty brown in deposit, measuring 6–8.5 x 4–4.5 μm, ellipsoid to subellipsoid, inequilateral, roughened and dextrinoid, with no germ pore.  The basidia measure 24–28 x 6–7 μm and are 4-spored.  The basidioles are often brown. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) measures 30–38 x 5–10 μm, hyaline, fusoid to subventricose.  The cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) measures 23–28 x 4–7 μm, ventricose to flash shaped, often capitate.  The lamellar flesh (trama) is made up of parallel hyphae 5–18 μm across, frequently septate, with yellowish pigment that is dissolved by potassium hydroxide. The pileus trama is interwoven, and the pileus cuticle has brown tufts of brown incrusted hyphae. The pileocystidia measure 44–53 μm, and are club-shaped, cylindrical or ventricose terminal elements on the hyphae that forms the scales on the cap. Cystidia on the stipe (caulocystidia) are 20–63 x 3–15 μm, club shaped, ventricose or flask shaped.  The gill trama and pileus trama are pale yellowish-brown in KOH and reddish brown in Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are present.",
    "Similar species": "It resembles Tricholomopsis rutilans, which has a white spore print.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "It grows in dense clusters on dead hardwoods and conifers in North America, where it is common. It appears generally from June to October, or September to March on the West Coast.",
    "Potential uses": "Its edibility is unknown. Mycologist David Arora notes that the related G. aeruginosus is psychoactive."

  "Gyromitra esculenta": {
    "Introduction": "Gyromitra esculenta  is an ascomycete fungus from the genus Gyromitra. The fruiting body, or mushroom, is an irregular brain-shaped cap, dark brown in colour, that can reach 10 centimetres (4 inches) high and 15 cm (6 in) wide, perched on a stout white stipe up to 6 cm (2+1⁄2 in) high. It is widely distributed across Europe and North America, normally fruiting in sandy soils under coniferous trees in spring and early summer.\nAlthough potentially fatal if eaten raw, G. esculenta is sometimes parboiled for consumption, being a popular delicacy in Europe and the upper Great Lakes region of North America. However, evidence suggests that thorough cooking does not eliminate all toxins. When consumed, the principal active mycotoxin, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine, which affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma, and death. Recent evidence suggests G. esculenta may be chronically toxic and linked to regional clusters of ALS.",
    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was first described in 1800, by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon, as Helvella esculenta, and gained its current accepted binomial name when the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries placed it in the genus Gyromitra in 1849.\nIt is known by a variety of common descriptive names such as \"brain mushroom\", \"turban fungus\", elephant ears, or \"beefsteak mushroom/morel\", although beefsteak mushroom can also refer to the much choicer edible basidiomycete Fistulina hepatica. Dating from the 19th century, the German term lorchel is a result of the older lorche, itself from the 18th century Low German Lorken, aligning with the similar-sounding (and similar-looking) morchel.\nGyromitra esculenta is a member of a group of fungi known as \"false morels\", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded true morels of the genus Morchella. The grouping includes other species of the genus Gyromitra, such as G. infula (elfin saddle), G. caroliniana and G. gigas (snow morel). While some of these species contain little to no gyromitrin, many guidebooks recommend treating them all as poisonous, since their similar appearance and significant intraspecific variation can make reliable identification difficult. The toxic qualities of G. esculenta may be reduced by cooking, but possibly not enough to prevent poisoning from repeated consumption.\nThe more distantly related ascomycete mushrooms of the genus Verpa, such as V. bohemica and V. conica, are also known as false morels, early morels or thimble morels; like the Gyromitra, they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.\nThe genus Gyromitra had been classically considered part of the family Helvellaceae, along with the similar-looking elfin saddles of the genus Helvella. Analysis of the ribosomal DNA of many of the Pezizales showed G. esculenta and the other false morels to be only distantly related to the other members of the Helvellaceae and instead most closely related to the genus Discina, forming a clade which also contains Pseudorhizina and Hydnotrya. Thus the four genera are now included in the family Discinaceae.",
    "Etymology": "The genus name is derived from the Greek terms gyros/γυρος \"round\" and mitra/μιτρα \"headband\". Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin esculentus, \"edible\".",
    "Description": "Resembling a brain, the irregularly shaped cap may be 12 centimetres (4+1⁄2 inches) or more high and wide. Initially smooth, it becomes progressively more wrinkled as it grows and ages. The cap is brownish, and can variously be shaded reddish, chestnut, purplish, or golden. It darkens to black in age. Specimens from California may have more reddish-brown caps. Attached to the cap at several points, the stipe is 3–6 cm (1–2+1⁄2 in) high and 1–5 cm (1⁄2–2 in) wide. G. esculenta has been reported to have a solid stipe whereas those of true morels (Morchella spp.) are hollow, although a modern source says it is hollow as well. The smell can be pleasant and has been described as fruity, and the fungus is mild-tasting.\nThe spore print is whitish, with transparent spores that are elliptical and 17–22 μm in length.",
    "Similar species": "G. esculenta resembles the various species of true morel, although the latter are more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown sponges. Its cap is generally darker and larger.\nG. gigas, G. infula and G. ambigua in particular are similar, the latter two being toxic to humans.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "G. esculenta grows on sandy soil in temperate coniferous forest and occasionally in deciduous woodlands. Among conifers it is mostly found under pines (Pinus spp.), but also sometimes under aspens (Populus spp.). The hunting period is from April to July, earlier than for other species, and the fungus may even sprout up with the melting snow. It can be abundant in some years and rare in others. The mushroom is more commonly found in places where ground has been disturbed, such as openings, rivulets, washes, timber clearings, plowed openings, forest fire clearings, and roadsides. Enthusiasts in Finland have been reported burying newspaper inoculated with the fungus in the ground in autumn and returning the following spring to collect mushrooms.\nAlthough more abundant in montane and northern coniferous woodlands such as the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, as far south as Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.",
    "Toxicity": "Toxic reactions have been known for at least a hundred years. Experts speculated the reaction was more of an allergic one specific to the consumer, or a misidentification, rather than innate toxicity of the fungus, due to the wide range in effects seen. Some would suffer severely or perish while others exhibited no symptoms after eating similar amounts of mushrooms from the same dish. Yet others would be not poisoned after eating G. esculenta for many years. However, the fungus is now widely recognized as potentially deadly.\nGyromitra esculenta contains levels of the poison gyromitrin that vary locally among populations; although these mushrooms are only rarely involved in poisonings in either North America or western Europe, intoxications are seen frequently in eastern Europe and Scandinavia. A 1971 Polish study reported at the time that the species accounted for up to 23% of mushroom fatalities each year. Death rates have dropped since the mid-twentieth century; in Sweden poisoning is common, though life-threatening poisonings have not been detected and there was no fatality reported over the 50 years from 1952 to 2002. Gyromitra poisonings are rare in Spain, due to the widespread practice of drying the mushrooms before preparation and consumption, but has a mortality rate of about 25%.\nA lethal dose of gyromitrin has been estimated to be 10–30 mg/kg for children and 20–50 mg/kg in adults. These doses correspond to around 0.2–0.6 kg (7 oz – 1 lb 5 oz) and 0.4–1 kg (14 oz – 2 lb 3 oz) of fresh mushroom respectively. Evidence suggests that children are more severely affected; it is unclear whether this is due to a larger weight consumed per body mass ratio or to differences in enzyme and metabolic activity.",
    "Geographical variation": "Populations of G. esculenta appear to vary geographically in their toxicity. A French study has shown that mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, and there is some evidence that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the USA have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.",
    "Biochemistry": "The identity of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile, water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into N-methyl-N-formylhydrazine (MFH) then monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.\nThe toxins react with pyridoxal-5-phosphate—the activated form of pyridoxine (vitamin B6)—and form a hydrazone. This reduces production of the neurotransmitter GABA via decreased activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase, producing the neurological symptoms. MMH also causes oxidative stress leading to methemoglobinemia.  Inhibition of diamine oxidase (histaminase) elevates histamine levels resulting in headaches, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nMFH, as a mushroom component and an intermediary product of gyromitrin hydrolysis, has toxicities of its own. MFH undergoes cytochrome P450-regulated oxidative metabolism which, via reactive nitrosamide intermediates, leads to formation of methyl radicals which lead to liver necrosis.",
    "Symptoms": "The symptoms of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea which may be bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.\nIn some cases there may be an asymptomatic phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3 days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged; in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (hyperglycemia) and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or kidney failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.",
    "Treatment": "Treatment is mainly supportive; gastric decontamination with activated charcoal may be beneficial if medical attention is sought within a few hours of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.\nPyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, can be used to counteract the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25 mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30 g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200 mg daily.",
    "Long-term effects": "ALS\nLagrange et al. presented in 2018 a link between life-long foraging for G. esculenta and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in French Alps populations. Similar ALS clusters possibly related to mushrooms are found near the Aosta Valley (Italy), in Sardinia, and in Michigan.\n\n\nCarcinogenicity\nMonomethylhydrazine, gyromitrin, raw Gyromitra esculenta, and N-methyl-N-formylhydrazine have been shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. Even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazones have been isolated from G. esculenta, and it is not known if all potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.",
    "Consumption": "Despite its recognized toxicity, G. esculenta is marketed and consumed in several countries or states in Europe and North America. It was previously consumed in Germany, with fungi picked in and exported from Poland; more recently, however, Germany and Switzerland discouraged consumption by prohibiting its sale. Similarly in Sweden, the Swedish National Food Administration warns that it is not fit for human consumption, and restricts purchase of fresh mushrooms to restaurants alone. The mushroom is still highly regarded and consumed in Bulgaria, being sold in markets and picked for export there. In some countries such as Spain, especially in the eastern Pyrenees, they are traditionally considered a delicacy, and many people report consuming them for many years with no ill effects. Despite this, the false morel is listed as hazardous in official mushroom lists published by the Catalan Government and sale to the public is prohibited throughout Spain. Outside of Europe, G. esculenta is consumed in the Great Lakes region and some western states in the United States.\nSelling and purchasing fresh false morels is legal in Finland, where it is highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are required by law to be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9 tonnes in 2006 and 32.7 tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a béchamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.\nWhile cooking the fungus removes (most of) the toxins, the cook can become poisoned by the hydrazine fumes given off by cooking.",
    "Controversies": "In 2015, Swedish chef Paul Svensson caused a controversy when he prepared a dish with Gyromitra esculenta in a TV show. Mushroom expert Monica Svensson criticized him for including it, because monomethylhydrazine is a known carcinogen and there is a risk that inexperienced people might misinterpret the recipe and omit the steps that reduce the toxicity level. She also expressed criticism to Per Morberg for similar reasons. Paul Svensson said that he was not aware of the carcinogenic effects and apologized afterwards, and he promised to remove Gyromitra from his dishes.",
    "Preparation": "Most of the gyromitrin must be removed to render false morels edible. The recommended procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom it is recommended that they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the free gyromitrin contents to a tenth. Significant amounts of gyromitrin are retained in the internal structure of the mushroom even after boiling. After 3 rounds of boiling for 5 minutes and discarding the water, the gyromitrin content is reduced to 6-15% of the original. After 5 rounds, this content is reduced to 7%. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. However, it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.\nMMH boils at 87.5 °C (190 °F) and thus readily vaporizes into the air when water containing fresh false morels is boiled. If boiling the mushrooms indoors, care should be taken to ensure adequate ventilation, and, if symptoms of monomethylhydrazine poisoning appear, immediately open all windows and move outside to seek fresh air. Even after boiling, small amounts of gyromitrin and other hydrazine derivatives remain in the mushrooms. Given the possibility of accumulation of toxins, repeated consumption is not recommended.",
    "Prospects for cultivation": "Strains with much lower concentrations of gyromitrin have been discovered, and the fungus has been successfully grown to fruiting in culture. Thus there is scope for future research into cultivation of safer strains."

  "Gyromitra gigas": {
    "Introduction": "Discina gigas, commonly known as the snow mushroom, snowbank false morel, walnut, giants false morel, snow morel, snow false morel, calf brain, or bull nose, is a species of fungus and a member of the Ascomycota found in Europe.\nIt is referred to as one of the false morels, due to its similar appearance and occurrence in the spring and early summer in similar habitats to true morels (Morchella ssp.).",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described scientifically by Julius Vincenz von Krombholz as Helvella gigas.",
    "Description": "The tannish, wrinkled cap grows up to 10 centimetres (4 in) broad and 6 cm tall. The whitish stalk is typically almost as thick as the cap, up to 10 cm long and broad.",
    "Similar species": "Many of the common names of Discina gigas refer to both its resemblance to true morels, Morchella ssp., and to the related genus Gyromitra.\nA very similar and directly related species, D. montana, occurs in North America; it apparently has larger spores than D. gigas. While both species are reportedly edible in small amounts if thoroughly cooked, eating is not recommended due to their similarity to more toxic species of mushrooms.",
    "Toxicity": "It contains small quantities of hydrazines; its content in gyromitrin was scientifically assessed by Viernstein et al. (1980) and resulted of about 1mg per kg of fresh mushroom (roughly 1,500-fold less compared to that of Gyromitra esculenta). Though no casualties have been ascribed to its consumption, parboiling is still highly recommended. Some guides have listed it as being edible if properly prepared. However, consumption is not recommended due to variability and similarity to other more toxic species of Gyromitra.\nThis fungus has been banned for sale in France since 1991 due to potential toxicity, the effects of which would cause a fairly rare fatal neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."
  },
  "Gyromitra infula": {
    "Introduction": "Paragyromitra infula, commonly known as the hooded false morel or the elfin saddle, is a species of fungus in the family Discinaceae. The dark reddish-brown caps of the fruit bodies develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The stipe is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside.\nP. infula is found in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. The species has been considered poisonous, believed to contain the toxic compound gyromitrin, but a 2023 study has thrown this into doubt.",
    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was first described in 1774 by the German mycologist Jacob Christian Schäffer as Helvella infula (the original genus spelling was Elvela). In 1849, Elias Magnus Fries established the genus Gyromitra, distinguishing it from Helvella based on a gyrose hymenium (marked with wavy lines or convolutions); the genus was based on the type species G. esculenta.  Later, in 1886, the French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred the species to Gyromitra. The next few decades witnessed some lingering confusion as to the correct taxonomical placement of these fungi.\nIn 1907, Jean Boudier moved both G. esculenta and H. infula into a newly created genus he called Physomitra; he retained the genus Gyromitra but \"based it on an entirely different character so as to exclude from the genus the very species on which it was founded\". In an attempt to reconcile the confusion surrounding the naming and identity of the two mushrooms, Fred J. Seaver proposed that both were synonymous, representing variable forms of the same species. His suggestion was not adopted by later mycologists, who identified various differences between the two species, including fruiting time as well as macroscopic and microscopic differences. The species is now classified in the newly erected genus Paragyromitra.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet is from the Latin infǔla, a heavy band of twisted wool worn by Roman officiants at sacrifices. It is known more commonly as the elfin saddle or the hooded false morel. Additionally, P. infula is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as \"false morels\", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible true morels of the genus Morchella. This group includes species such as Gyromitra esculenta (brain mushroom), Discina caroliniana (beefsteak mushroom) and Discina  gigas (snow morel).",
    "Description": "The cap of the fruit body (technically an apothecium) is about 2.5–9 cm (1–3+1⁄2 in) wide and tall, reddish to orangish brown, and saddle-shaped with 2–4 lobes. It is chambered or hollow within and frequently develops blackish-brown spots on the surface. During the mushroom's development, the cap's periphery grows into the stipe below to form a hollow, roughly bell-shaped structure with the fertile spore-bearing surface (the hymenium) on the outside; as the surface growth of the hymenium continues to expand even after joining to the stipe, the hymenium can no longer follow and it arches up into folds and pads.\nThe mostly hollow stipe is between 2–8 cm (3⁄4–3+1⁄8 in) high and 1–2.5 cm (3⁄8–1 in) thick, varying in color from reddish brown to whitish or even bluish, but is typically lighter than the cap. The stipe is minutely tomentose – covered with a layer of very fine hairs. The context (flesh) is 1–2 millimetres thick, brittle, and whitish to brownish. It lacks a notable odor or taste.\n\nAscospores are ellipsoidal in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with dimensions of 17–22 by 7–9 μm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17 |μm. The diameter of the club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10 μm at the apex.",
    "Similar species": "Gyromitra esculenta has a wrinkled surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like P. infula. Paragyromitra ambigua is very similar in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, P. ambigua is said to have more pronounced purple tints in the stipe and has larger spores (about 22–30 μm long). Discina brunnea is more stout with a white stem, with a wrinkled cap which usually lacks points.\nThe saddle-shaped cap of P. infula might also lead to confusion with some species of the genus Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes (e.g. H. maculata which has distinctly white flesh).",
    "Distribution and habitat": "P. infula is widely distributed throughout boreal, montane and coastal forests in North America. The North American range extends north to Canada and south to Mexico. It has also been reported from South America, Europe, and Asia.\nThe fungus can be found growing singly to scattered in or near coniferous woodland in autumn, often on rotten wood. It is also commonly found on packed ground, such as beside country roads, or in campgrounds. Associated conifers include Picea glauca, P. mariana, P. sitchensis, Pinus contorta, P. banksiana, P. monticola, Abies balsamea, A. grandis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Tsuga heterophylla, Larix occidentalis, Thuja plicata, as well as the deciduous tree species Populus balsamifera, P. tremuloides, Acer macrophyllum, Alnus species, and Betula papyrifera.",
    "Toxicity": "This fungus has been widely regarded as poisonous, as it was long believed to contain the toxic compound gyromitrin, present in some species of Gyromitra, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, a major component of rocket fuel. However, a 2023 study found no traces of gyromitrin in G. infula (now called Paragyromitra infula) using a new chromatography method."

  "Hericium erinaceus": {
    "Introduction": "Hericium erinaceus, commonly known as lion's mane, yamabushitake, bearded tooth fungus, or bearded hedgehog, is a species of tooth fungus. It tends to grow in a single clump with dangling spines longer than 1 centimetre (1⁄2 inch). It can be mistaken for other Hericium species that grow in the same areas. \nNative to North America and Eurasia, the mushrooms are common during late summer and autumn on hardwoods, particularly American beech and maple. It is typically considered saprophytic, as it mostly feeds on dead trees. It can also be found on living trees, usually in association with a wound.\nIt is an edible mushroom and used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is generally safe to eat, but its medicinal effectiveness, safety in supplements, and active compounds are unproven.",
    "Etymology": "Both the Latin genus name Hericium and the species name erinaceus mean 'hedgehog' in Latin. This is also reflected by the German name, Igel-Stachelbart (literally, 'hedgehog-goatee'), and some of its common English names, such as bearded hedgehog and hedgehog mushroom. It is known in Japan as yamabushitake (Kanji: 山伏茸, Katakana: ヤマブシタケ) in reference to the yamabushi or mountain ascetics of the syncretistic religion known as Shugendo; while in Chinese, it is known as hóutóugū (simplified Chinese: 猴头菇; traditional Chinese: 猴頭菇; Jyutping: hau4 tou4 gu1) meaning \"monkey-head mushroom\", in Korea as noru gungdeng-i beoseot (노루궁뎅이버섯) meaning \"deer butt mushroom\", and in Europe and the United States as lion's mane.",
    "Description": "The fruit bodies of H. erinaceus are large, irregular bulbous tubercules. They are 5–40 centimetres (2–15+1⁄2 inches) in diameter and dominated by crowded, hanging, spore-producing spines, which are 1–5 cm (1⁄2–2 in) long or longer.\nThe hyphal system is monomitic, amyloid, and composed of thin- to thick-walled hyphae that are approximately 3–15 μm (microns) wide. The hyphae also contain clamped septa and gloeoplerous elements (filled with oily, resinous substances), which can come into the hymenium as gloeocystidia.\nThe basidia are 25–40 μm long and 5–7 μm wide, contain four spores each and possess a basal clamp. The white amyloid spores measure approximately 5–7 μm in length and 4–5 μm in width. The spore shape is described as subglobose to short ellipsoid and the spore surface is smooth to finely roughened.",
    "Development": "It has been observed that H. erinaceus can fruit intermittently for 20 years on the same dead tree. It is hypothesized that H. erinaceus can survive for 40 years. The mating system of H. erinaceus species found in the U.S. was shown to be bifactorially heterothallic.\nThe monokaryotic mycelium growth of H. erinaceus is slower than dikaryotic growth and only a relatively low percentage of monokaryotic cultures yield fruitbodies. Monokaryotic fruitbodies are also smaller than dikaryotic fruitbodies. The monokaryotic mycelium was found to produce fusoid to subglobose chlamydospores of 6–8 x 8–10 μm size. These spores can stay viable for more than seven years and be stored under anaerobic conditions. Chlamydospore germination requires 30 to 52 hours, with a germination success rate of 32 to 54%.\nSpore production is highest at midday, relative to temperature increase and a decrease of relative humidity. Daily trends toward lower relative humidity can favor sporulation, however, levels of relative humidity that are too low do not favor high total spore production.",
    "Mycochemistry": "H. erinaceus contains diverse chemicals, including polysaccharides, such as β-glucan, as well as hericenones and erinacines. From its essential oil, 77 aroma and flavor compounds were identified, including hexadecanoic acid (26% of total oil composition), linoleic acid (13%), phenylacetaldehyde (9%) and benzaldehyde (3%), and other oils, such as 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2-ethylpyrazine and 2,6-diethylpyrazine. Low concentrations of ergosterol are present.\nMany of these compounds, particularly erinacines and hericenones, are able to readily cross the blood-brain barrier to increase their bioavailability in the brain. Erinacines have been shown to have effects on neuroprotection, antioxidant activity and neuroplasticity in the brain.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species in the genus include H. americanum and H. coralloides, both found in eastern North America. Additional species with a resemblance include Donkia pulcherrima, Radulomyces copelandii and some within Sarcodontia.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "In Europe, the fruit bodies of H. erinaceus are mainly produced annually from August to November. In North America, they appear from October to February in the west, from July to October in the Mountain states, and from September to February in the east.\nIn the wild, lion's mane is usually associated with a tree wound and causes a white pocket rot. Decayed tissue becomes spongy and eventually disintegrates to form a cavity. The distinctive fruiting bodies (basidiocarps) generally appear near the edges of old wounds in autumn. It may be a tree parasite, possibly indicating an endophytic habitat. \nH. erinaceus hosts in North America include maple, ash, oaks, and eucalyptus. In California, lion's mane has been found on coast live oak, canyon live oak, interior live oak, California black oak, blue oak, and valley oak.\nLion's mane is able to withstand cold temperatures and frost conditions.",
    "Disease": "Brennandania lambi (Acari: Pygmephoroidea) is a mite pest of fungi culture in China. This mite can develop and reproduce on the mycelium of H. erinaceus. Farm hygiene and heat treatments are the most important pest management strategies that should be followed to counter this acarus.",
    "Competition with other fungi": "Hericium species are good competitors against other wood colonisers. They show the ability to maintain their place on dead wood, also when confronted with secondary colonizers, such as Trametes versicolor and Stereum hirsutum. Hericium erinaceus has shown to be slightly more competitive than other fungi tooth species, including Creolophus cirrhatus and H. coralloides.",
    "Conservation": "Although H. erinaceus is native to Europe, it has been red listed in several European countries due to poor germination and establishment.",
    "Cultivation": "In fungi cultivation, fungal strains are analogous to plant varieties in crop breeding. Fungal strains comprise clonal descendants of a single isolation from one fungal colony in a pure culture. The production of H. erinaceus is widespread in Asia, mostly using extensive production practices on wood logs or stumps.\nAlthough there is considerable scientific research about Hericium spp., they are not commonly industrially produced in the West. Accordingly, there are few commercially available strains in the U.S. or Europe and little or no breeding for higher yield or other favorable traits has occurred.  Production trials in Egypt report yields of H. erinaceus averaging at 165 g per 1 kg medium.\nIn North America, its production occurs only on a small scale. Most of it is intensive indoor production with only a few small outdoor sites where log cultivation is practiced.",
    "Substrate requirements": "As a saprophyte that occurs on dead wood, H. erinaceus requires adequate substrate factors, including suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, a certain pH value and ideal carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. \nMany different substrates have been used to successfully cultivate this mushroom. Depending on the type of cultivation, the substrate can be either solid (artificial log) or liquid (submerged culture and deep submerged culture). \nThe solid substrate is most commonly a mixture of sawdust of hardwood or conifer containing different complements that may include wheat bran, wheat straw, soybean meal, corn meal, rice bran, and rice straw. For example, H. erinaceus strains grow on beech sawdust substrate enriched with wheat bran (20%), rye grain (25%), soybean meal (7%), rapeseed meal (10%), or meat-osseous flour (6%). \nAn example of a liquid substrate composition can be glucose for the carbon source, soybean powder, corn powder, and wheat bran powder as a complex nitrogen source. The pH values most suitable for the favorable growth of H. erinaceus were in the range of 5.0–9.0, with pH 6.0 as optimal.",
    "Climate requirements": "Hericium erinaceus requires a humid environment for its growth: 85 to 90% of relative humidity in the air. The incubation temperature most suitable for the mycelial growth of H. erinaceus was found to be 25 °C, and the optimum temperature for vegetative growth was 26 °C. H. erinaceus is unable to grow with a water potential lower than -5 Mpa.",
    "Techniques": "The artificial cultivation of H. erinaceus was first reported in China in 1988. It is cultivated using artificial logs, bottles, and polypropylene bags. However, this type of artificial cultivation is not suitable for industrialized production due to its low yield and long cultivation cycles.\nSubmerged culture is a type of artificial cultivation of H. erinaceus whereby the fungus is grown in a liquid medium. Using this method, a large number of mycelia can be obtained quickly. Bioactive compounds can be sourced from the fruiting bodies, submerged-cultivated mycelial biomass, or liquid-cultivated broth. Growers optimize the culture medium composition to obtain simultaneously high yields of H. erinaceus mycelial biomass, exopolysaccharides, and polysaccharides. Submerged fermentation is preferable for the production of mycelial biomass and biologically active metabolites in order to produce a more uniform biomass and extract products.\nGrowth regulators, such as 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and gibberellin, were observed to have an advantageous effect on spore germination. Other technologies, such as red and green laser light of low intensity, stimulated spore germination as well as the vegetative growth of mycelium. Argon and helium lasers also contributed to the acceleration of fruit body development by 36–51%.",
    "Wild strains": "Wild strains of Hericium spp. can be isolated and cultivated by first gathering fruiting bodies from fallen trees in the natural habitat. The fruiting bodies can then be opened to attain pieces of their inner spore-producing tissue. This tissue is then placed onto Petri dishes with agar to cultivate fungal colonies at 25 °C. After several transfers to new Petri dishes to verify the purity of the strain, it can be kept at −80 °C for long-term storage.",
    "Culinary": "The edible fruiting bodies are common in gourmet cooking, with young specimens considered the best. Alongside shiitake (Lentinus edodes) and oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus) mushrooms, H. erinaceus is used as a specialty mushroom in recipes.\nH. erinaceus fruiting bodies contain 57% carbohydrates (8% as dietary fiber), 4% fat, and 22% protein.",
    "Traditional and contemporary uses": "Used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, H. erinaceus is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement for its purported benefits to memory, but lacks sufficient scientific evidence for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.\nThough it is a generally safe edible mushroom, its efficacy and specific active compounds remain unconfirmed in vivo."

  "Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca": {
    "Introduction": "Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, commonly known as the false chanterelle, is a species of fungus in the family Hygrophoropsidaceae.\nAustrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen described the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then placed in the genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that it belongs to the order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.\nThe fruit bodies (mushrooms) are yellow–orange, with a funnel-shaped cap up to 8 cm (3 in) across that has a felt-like surface. The thin, often forked gills on the underside of the cap run partway down the length of the otherwise smooth stipe. The species is found across several continents, growing in woodland and heathland, and sometimes on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping. Reports on the mushroom's edibility vary; it is considered poisonous, but has historically been eaten in parts of Europe and the Americas.",
    "Taxonomy": "Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen described the false chanterelle as Agaricus aurantiacus in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the fir tree forests around Klagenfurt in October. He added that it could be confused with the chanterelle by the inexperienced, but that its true nature was very different; in contrast to its edible lookalike, he described it as \"kind of pernicious\". The specific epithet is the Latin word aurantiacus, meaning \"orange\". James Sowerby illustrated it and gave it the name Agaricus subcantharellus, describing it as a \"perhaps unfavourable\" variety of A. cantharellus (chanterelle). The fungus was placed in the genus Merulius by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and then Cantharellus by Elias Fries in 1821. Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded it could only be classified in the genus Clitocybe in 1900, based on its white spores, decurrent gills and lack of a ring. It was elevated to the status of genus in a 1929 publication by Emile Martin-Sans, with authorship attributed to René Maire. Martin-Sans concurred with Maire's assessment of Hygrophoropsis, suggesting that it represented a form intermediate between Cantharellus and Clitocybe, and was thus worthy of generic ranking. The genus name refers to a resemblance to the genus Hygrophorus. It is commonly known as the false chanterelle.\n\nTwo varieties described by Derek Reid in 1972, H. aurantiaca var. macrospora and H. aurantiaca var. rufa, have since been promoted to distinct species status as H. macrospora (1996) and H. rufa (2008). Two other varieties of the fungus have been described, but they are not considered to have independent taxonomic significance by Index Fungorum: var. nana (Singer 1946), characterized by a small fruit body; and var. robusta (Antonín 2000), characterized by a robust fruit body and an odour similar to Maggi seasoning sauce. Pale forms of the fungus are sometimes referred to as var. pallida. This taxon was first published by Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi in 1953, but later considered invalid as it did not conform to nomenclatural rules. Variety nigripes, a taxon with a black-brown stipe, is invalid for similar reasons. H. aurantiaca var. pallida was published validly in 1995.\nIn 1979, Egon Horak suggested that H. aurantiaca and the New Zealand taxon H. coacta were the same species, but neither Index Fungorum nor MycoBank accept this synonymy. According to MycoBank, H. aurantiaca has several heterotypic synonyms, i.e. different types but considered the same species:\n\nAgaricus alectorolophoides Schaeff. (1774)\nAgaricus subcantharellus Sowerby (1809)\nCantharellus brachypodus Chevall. (1826)\nCantharellus ravenelii Berk. & M.A.Curtis (1853)\nMerulius brachypodes (Chevall.) Kuntze (1891)\nHygrophoropsis aurantiaca has been confused with the true chanterelles (genus Cantharellus) because of overall similarities in appearance. However, the forked gills, frequently off-centre stipe placement, and dextrinoid spores of H. aurantiaca suggested a relationship with Paxillus, prompting Rolf Singer to classify the genus Hygrophoropsis in the family Paxillaceae in 1946. Several pigments have been identified from the fungus, including the orange variegatic acid, methyl variegate, the red variegatorubin, and several derivatives of pulvinic acid. The presence of these pigments suggests a chemotaxic relationship with the Boletaceae, Coniophoraceae, and Paxillaceae – families of Boletales with members that have similar compounds. Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed its affinity lay in the order Boletales in 1997, though later research showed it is not closely related to Paxillus or other gilled members of the order.",
    "Description": "The species has a golden-orange cap ranging from 2–10 cm (3⁄4–4 in) in diameter, initially convex but becoming funnel-shaped as the mushroom matures. The cap margin, which remains rolled in a little, becomes wavy or lobed in age. The cap surface is covered with a fine down. The decurrent gill-like structures are narrow and forked, which is a distinctive and distinguishing feature. They are generally a more intense shade of orange than the cap. Along the stipe, the gills may be slightly crimped. The orange stipe is 1.5–8 cm (5⁄8–3+1⁄8 in) tall and 0.5–1 cm (1⁄4–3⁄8 in) thick, and lacks a ring. It often has a darker, brownish, base. The ability to form sclerotia (compact masses of hardened fungal mycelium) has been documented for H. aurantiaca in laboratory studies. These structures contain glycogen and protein that may be used as food reserves during spore germination.\nThe soft, thin flesh ranges from white to yellowish to golden-orange. It has an odour and taste described variously as indistinct, or unpleasant and earthy. The spore print is white to cream. The oval spores are 5.5–7 by 4–4.5 micrometres (μm), with walls that tend to thicken in age. The spores are cyanophilous, meaning they will readily stain dark blue in methyl blue solution. Staining with Melzer's reagent often produces a dextrinoid (reddish-brown) colour reaction. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 25–40 by 5–8 μm, and can be two-, three-, or four-spored. Cystidia (large sterile cells on the hymenium) are absent. The cap cuticle is in the form of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae are roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 4–15 μm in diameter, and contain intracellular pigments that impart an orange-brown to yellow-brown colouring to the cells. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.\nTeratological (developmentally abnormal) forms of H. aurantiaca have been reported to occur in the United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with a wrinkled upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or virus infection have been suggested as contributing factors.",
    "Similar species": "Characteristics typically used in the field to distinguish Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca from lookalike species include: the soft, dry consistency of its cap; the crowded, decurrent, and forked gills that are saffron to orange coloured; and the lack of any distinctive taste or odour. The false chanterelle can be distinguished from the true chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) by its deeper orange colour, brown base to the stipe, velvety cap surface, forked gills rather than gill-like ridges, softer (and thinner) flesh, and lack of the characteristic apricot-smell. The cap surface of Hygrophoropsis fuscosquamula, found in Britain, has fine brown scales overlaying a dull orange background. H. rufa has velvety brown fur covering its cap, while H. macrospora has cream gills and stipe. Microscopically, these three species have larger spores than H. aurantiaca. H. tapinia, found in a range extending from southern Florida to Central America, is set apart from H. aurantiaca by its growth on or under deciduous trees (never conifers), and smaller spores, which measure 3.3–4.8 by 2.5–3.3 μm.\nFormerly a member of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in appearance to H. aurantiaca but can be distinguished from the false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a yellowish brown cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown spore print and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H. aurantiaca, is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork. Additionally, species of Infundibulicybe and Paralepista have unforked cream-to-tan gills.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is a widely distributed species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both hardwood and conifer forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn. In North America, it can be found from July–October to the east and September–January on the West Coast. It can be found in Central and South America, and Mexico, where it is common in coniferous forests. It has also been recorded in northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Populations in California represent a complex of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca sensu lato.\nIt fruits from the ground or from decaying wood, on burned areas in forests, and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps. The fungus can also grow on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other locations where this material is used. Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters, and can be very abundant. Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce.",
    "Ecology": "A saprophytic fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains nutrients from forest litter and decomposing wood, causing a brown rot on the wood upon which it grows.\nH. aurantiaca secretes large amounts of oxalic acid, a reducing agent and relatively strong acid. This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.",
    "Edibility": "The false chanterelle is considered poisonous and may cause serious digestive problems. Among other toxins, it contains high levels of the sugar alcohol arabitol. The mushroom was sometimes described as edible (though not tasty) until 1999. Fries described it as venenatus, meaning \"poisonous\", in 1821. Considering the species potentially edible, David Arora speculated that it may have been confused with similar-looking but definitely poisonous species of Omphalotus. Italian mycologist Nicola Sitta has reported that the one attributed case of poisoning he knew of could be attributed to an idiosyncratic reaction as only one of three people eating it got symptoms and concludes that it is harmless. It is eaten in Spain and France, and can legally be sold in France and Belgium. It is not recommended in Italy due to its similarity to poisonous species. It is eaten, though not  highly regarded, by the Zapotec people of Ixtlán de Juárez in Oaxaca. The Tepehuán people of northwestern Mexico also occasionally eat the mushroom, which they refer to in their native language as guin'xacan (\"delightful\") or kia's gio' (\"iguana lard\"); there, it is commonly prepared by roasting over charcoal, or boiling and garnishing with cheese."

  "Hypholoma fasciculare": {
    "Introduction": "Hypholoma fasciculare, commonly known as the sulphur tuft or clustered woodlover,  is a common woodland mushroom, often in evidence when hardly any other mushrooms are to be found. This saprotrophic small gill fungus grows prolifically in large clumps on stumps, dead roots or rotting trunks of broadleaved trees.\nThe \"sulphur tuft\" is bitter and poisonous; consuming it can cause vomiting, diarrhea and convulsions.",
    "Taxonomy": "The specific epithet is derived from the Latin fascicularis  'in bundles' or 'clustered',  referring to its habit of growing in clumps. Its name in Japanese is Nigakuritake (苦栗茸, means \"Bitter kuritake\").",
    "Description": "The hemispherical cap ranges from 2–8 cm (3⁄4–3+1⁄8 in) in diameter. It is smooth and sulphur yellow with an orange-brown centre and whitish margin. The crowded gills are initially yellow but darken to a distinctive green colour as the blackish spores develop on the yellow flesh. It has a purple-brown spore print. The stipe is 3–12 cm (1+1⁄8–4+3⁄4 in) tall and 3–10 mm wide, light yellow, orange-brown below, often with an indistinct ring zone coloured dark by the spores. The taste is very bitter.",
    "Similar species": "The edible Hypholoma capnoides is similar, but lacks the greenish-yellow gills and bitter taste. H. sublateritium is similar as well, with a reddish cap. Members of Pyrrhulomyces may also appear similar.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "The spores are purple-black in colour. The spores are 6–8 × 4–4.5 μm in size and are shaped like an egg.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Hypholoma fasciculare grows prolifically on the dead wood of both deciduous and coniferous trees. It is more commonly found on decaying deciduous wood due to the lower lignin content of this wood relative to coniferous wood.  Hypholoma fasciculare is widespread and abundant in northern Europe and North America. It has been recorded from Iran, and also eastern Anatolia in Turkey. It can appear anytime from spring to autumn.",
    "Use in forestry": "Hypholoma fasciculare has been used successfully as an experimental treatment to competitively displace a common fungal disease of conifers, Armillaria root rot, from managed coniferous forests.",
    "Toxicity": "The toxicity of sulfur tuft mushrooms has been attributed, at least partially, to the toxic steroids fasciculol E and fasciculol F (in mice, with LD50(i.p.) values of 50 mg/kg and 168 mg/kg, respectively). These fasciculols have been shown to be calmodulin inhibitors. In humans, symptoms may be delayed for 5–10 hours after consumption, after which time there may be diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, proteinuria and collapse. Paralysis and impaired vision have been recorded. Symptoms generally resolve over a few days. The autopsy of one fatality revealed fulminant hepatitis reminiscent of amatoxin poisoning, along with involvement of kidneys and myocardium. The mushroom was consumed in a dish with other species so the death cannot be attributed to sulfur tuft with certainty.",
    "Potential uses": "Extracts of the mushroom show anticoagulant effects."

  "Hypholoma lateritium": {
    "Introduction": "Hypholoma lateritium, sometimes called brick cap, chestnut mushroom, cinnamon cap, brick top, red woodlover or kuritake, is a species of fungus in the genus Hypholoma, which also contains the slightly smaller poisonous species Hypholoma fasciculare.",
    "Taxonomy": "Hypholoma sublateritium is a synonym.",
    "Description": "The cap is 3.5–9 centimetres (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄2 in) in diameter, usually with a brick-red coloration in the center and a paler margin.  It is smooth, sometimes with red-brown flecks in the middle and sometimes with flaky veil remnants, which can easily be washed off in the rain, on the outside. The gills are crowded, starting yellowish and becoming grayish with age. They do not have the green color of Hypholoma fasciculare. The stipe is up to 12 cm (4+3⁄4 in) long, light yellow and darker below.\nThe spores have a germ pore and are 6.0–7.5 × 3.5–4.0 μm. The cheilocystidia are variable; the spore print is purple-brown.",
    "Similar species": "It could be confused with highly toxic species such as Galerina marginata or Hypholoma fasciculare. It can also resemble Pholiota mixta and members of Pyrrhulomyces.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "In Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and West Virginia they are found in dense clusters on stumps and roots from October until long after frosts.",
    "Edibility": "Hypholoma lateritium is sometimes considered edible but caution must be taken to avoid confusing it with similar-looking deadly species. In Europe the species is often considered inedible or even poisonous. Specimens are best when collected young; older specimens tend to be bitter from being fouled by insects.\nThe taste is mild to somewhat bitter, but when cooked the mushrooms have a nutty flavor.  They are especially delicious when sauteed in olive oil. Brick tops have been considered one of the better edibles of late fall in the Northeast United States. It is considered a choice edible in Japan."

  "Hypogymnia physodes": {
    "Introduction": "Hypogymnia physodes, commonly known as the monk's-hood lichen, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. It is a common and widespread species in boreal and temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a grey to yellowish-green thallus that is loosely attached to its substrate and forms large irregular patches. Hollow lobes are 2–3mm wide. The outer edge turns up and is frequently covered with white powdery soredia underneath. Its lower surface is black, wrinkled and has some browning toward the lobe margins. The pycnidia are black and abundant, and their presence creates a pepper-like effect across the upper surface. Because of its abundance and its moderate sensitivity to sulphur dioxide and heavy metals, Hypogymnia physodes is often used in bioindicator and biomonitoring studies that enable the assessment of air pollution and other environmental conditions.",

  "Hypomyces lactifluorum": {
    "Introduction": "Hypomyces lactifluorum, or the lobster mushroom, is a parasitic ascomycete fungus that grows on certain species of mushrooms, turning them a reddish orange color that resembles the outer shell of a cooked lobster. The fungus is edible.",
    "Taxonomy": "The common name 'lobster mushroom' refers to the visual similarity of affected species to the lobster, but Hypomyces lactifluorum is not in fact a mushroom; it is a parasite that attacks them.",
    "Description": "H. lactifluorum specifically attacks members of the genera Lactarius and Lactifluus (milk-caps), as well as Russula (brittlegills), such as Russula brevipes and Lactifluus piperatus in North America. At maturity, the reddish orange H. lactifluorum thoroughly covers its host, rendering it unidentifiable. As it ages, its color can go from the entire sporocarp surface and lamella to the margin of the mushroom.\nThe species produces a white spore print.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include Hypomyces cervinigenus, H. chrysospermus, and H. luteovirens. Turbinellus floccosus has a similarly colored cap, but its underside has fine wrinkles rather than wavy gills. White, pink, and yellow molds could be toxic lookalike species.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Hypomyces lactifluorum is found in wooded areas, often near Russula brevipes or Lactarius growing in conifer forests, in particular under ponderosa pine in the American Southwest and the Pacific Northwest. Its range in the woods has been described as \"solitary, scattered or gregarious\" depending on location.",
    "Uses": "Lobster mushrooms are widely eaten and enjoyed freshly foraged and cooked. They are commercially marketed and sometimes found in grocery stores; they have been made available at markets in Oregon. They have a seafood-like flavor and a firm, dense texture.\nWhile edible, field guides note the hypothetical possibility that H. lactifluorum could parasitize a toxic host and that individuals should avoid consuming lobster mushrooms with unknown hosts, although no instances of toxicity have been recorded.  During the course of infection, the chemicals get converted into other more flavorful compounds, making lobster mushrooms more edible. Lactarius piperatus has a spicy, hot flavor but that flavor is counteracted by the parasite H. lactifluorum, making it more edible and delicious. One author notes that he has personally never experienced any trouble from consuming them and another notes that there have been no reports of poisoning in hundreds of years of consumption.",
    "Research": "A study from Quebec found that an infected R. brevipes mushroom mostly contained lobster mushroom DNA, with only trace amounts from the original species. This study also measured intermediate products of chemical reactions, or metabolites, in infected and non-infected mushrooms. Metabolites help determine how fungi look and taste, and whether they are fit to eat. They found that through the course of its infection, the parasitic fungus completely alters the diversity and amount of metabolites in R. brevipes."

  "Imleria badia": {
    "Introduction": "Imleria badia, commonly known as the bay bolete, is a species of pored mushroom. First described scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the bay bolete was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, and it is still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from the same common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus.\nBoth the common and scientific names refer to the bay- or chestnut-coloured cap, which is almost spherical in young specimens before broadening and flattening out to a diameter up to 15 cm (6 in). On the cap underside are small yellowish pores that turn dull blue-grey when bruised. The smooth, cylindrical stipe, measuring 4–9 cm (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄2 in) long by 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) thick, is coloured like the cap, but paler. The species is found in Eurasia and North America, growing in coniferous or mixed woods on the ground or on decaying tree stumps, sometimes in prolific numbers. Some varieties have also been described from eastern North America, differing from the main type in both macroscopic and microscopic morphology.\nOften considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I. badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster contained several times more caesium-137 than those collected before the incident.",
    "Taxonomy": "The bay bolete was first named as Boletus castaneus ß badius (i.e. a subspecies of Boletus castaneus) by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries later renamed it as a variety of Boletus castaneus in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work Elenchus Fungorum. The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: Rostkovites by Petter Karsten in 1881; Viscipellis and Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and Suillus by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus Xerocomus, and many sources still list it thus. Review of Xerocomus strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in Xerocomus, and hence it was left in Boletus until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that Imleria badia is related to B. pallidus and B. glabellus; the three species form a clade known informally as the badius clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the Tylopilus, porcini (= Boletus sensu stricto) and Strobilomyces clades, as well as two other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus (the taxa designated as Xerocomus species in this clade are not Xerocomus species and require new taxonomic designations) and Xerocomellus.\nThe species Boletus limatulus, originally published by Charles Christopher Frost in 1874, was later redescribed, \"with a slight tinge of irritation at the time, energy and gasoline spent\", as a variety of I. badia by Wally Snell in 1945 (as Xerocomus badius var. limatulus). The taxon name comes from the Latin limatulus, \"rather polished\" or \"refined\". Varieties glaber and macrostipitatus were described from Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1976.\nThe starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, the \"father of mycology\". Rolf Singer argued that setting the starting date earlier to Christiaan Persoon's 1801 publication of Synopsis would make a name change necessary, as he had originally given what is now known as Royoporus badius the combination Boletus badius Pers. and if the bay bolete was classified in the genus Boletus, the name would be unavailable and the names Boletus glutinosus Krombh. or B. spadiceus Krombh. (non Fr.) would have to be used instead.\nThe species name is the Latin adjective badia, meaning \"chestnut brown\". The common name is likewise derived from the colour of the cap, likened to the coat of a bay horse. Alternate common names of a similar derivation include bay-brown bolete and bay-capped bolete, and it is known as bolet bai in French. It is also known as the false cep. Variety glaber was named for its smooth (Latin: glaber, \"without hairs\") stipe, and macrostipitatus for its large (Latin: macro, \"large\") stipe.",
    "Description": "Imleria badia fruit bodies have a chestnut to dark brown cap, which is almost spherical in young specimens before broadening and flattening out to a diameter of up to 10 cm (4 in). The cap has an acute margin and a velvety surface when young, being slightly sticky when wet or old. The cap cuticle is difficult to separate from the flesh underneath. On the cap undersurface, the pores are initially cream to pale yellow, but become greenish yellow or olive with age. They stain dull blue to bluish-grey when bruised or cut, and are easily removed from the flesh. The pores are initially circular, becoming more angular with age, and number about one or two per millimetre. The tubes are 0.8–1.5 cm (3⁄8–5⁄8 in) long, and are adnate to depressed around the area of attachment to the stipe.\nThe flesh is mostly whitish or yellowish in some places; underneath the cap cuticle, it is brownish-pink or reddish brown. Initially firm, it begins to soften under the cap in older mushrooms. In some parts of the cap, such as the junction of the cap and the stipe, the flesh stains pale blue when injured or exposed to air, particularly in damp weather. This change is sometimes faint, and not persistent, as it eventually reverts to its original colour. The stipe is 4–9 cm (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄2 in) long by 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) thick, and is similar in colour to the cap but paler, and sometimes with a rose-coloured tinge. Its surface has faint longitudinal ridges, a fine powdering, and fine reticulations (a net-like pattern of ridges) at the apex. It often has a whitish region at the base and the top, and white mycelium at the base. Unlike the bulbous stipe of many other boletes, the stipe of B. badius remains relatively slim and cylindrical. The flesh of the stipe gets tougher with age. Its smell has been described as fruity.\nThe spore print is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are somewhat oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10 μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14 μm.\nVariety B. b. macrostipitatus differs from the main form by its grey-orange cap, shorter stipe measuring 5–7 cm (2–3 in), longer spores (15–18 by 4–5 μm), and longer pleurocystidia (30–55 by 10–14 μm). The variety B. b. glaber has a smooth (glabrous) stipe, and smaller pleurocystidia (35–40 by 10–15 μm) and cheilocystidia (25–30 by 9–12 μm).\nSeveral chemical tests can be used to help identify the mushroom. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) sulphate solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide.",
    "Similar species": "The similar colouration may cause confusion with Boletus projectellus, but the latter species is usually more robust, and has a reticulated stipe.  Additionally, B. projectellus has the largest spores in the Boletaceae, up to about 30 μm in diameter. Another lookalike is Austroboletus gracilis, but this species does not have a blue bruising reaction, and its pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish. Compared to I. badia, B. subtomentosus fruit bodies have narrower stipes, paler brown, dry caps, and wider pores that do not stain blue on bruising. This latter species is not as good to eat. In western North America, I. badia is replaced by the similar B. zelleri, which also grows both on the ground and on rotten wood. The European species Xerocomus bubalinus can be mistaken for I. badia, but it has a paler yellow-brown cap flushed with pinkish-red, and is not sticky when wet.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The bay bolete is common in coniferous and less commonly mixed woodlands in Europe, from the British Isles, where it is abundant throughout from August to November, east to the Black Sea Region in Turkey. In Asia, the species has been recorded from Jordan mainland China, and Taiwan. The North American distribution extends from eastern Canada west to Minnesota and south to North Carolina, where the mushroom fruits from July to November. It also grows in central Mexico. The variety B. b. macrostipitatus is found from eastern Canada south to Maine and New York state, while variety B. b. glaber is known from the Atlantic Maritime Ecozone of eastern Canada.\nFruit bodies appear singly or scattered on the ground, or on decaying tree stumps, and can be well hidden by pine needles and ferns. Fruiting tends to peak three or four days after rain during warm weather. They can be prolific, especially in highland areas that are humid and shady. The species is commonly found under white pine, spruce, and hemlock, and also occurs under deciduous trees, especially beech. It can also occur in grassy or mossy areas at or near forest margins; Italian restaurateur and cook Antonio Carluccio recalled picking them in the grounds of Blenheim Palace. It does not occur on calcareous (chalky) soils.",
    "Ecology": "Although the bay bolete is predominantly a mycorrhizal species, it has some saprophytic tendencies it may be able to use in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I. badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.\nI. badia fruit bodies are less affected by insects than other boletes. Orbatid mites such as Carabodes femoralis, Nothrus silvestris and Oribatula tibialis eat them, as do squirrels. Several microbial pathogens can damage the fruit bodies, and have had an effect on populations in China, including soft rot caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and black mould caused by  Mucor, Sepedonium, Paecilomyces, and Diasporangium species.",
    "Uses": "Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I. badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.\nThe fruit bodies can be used to make mushroom dyes. Depending on the mordant used, colours ranging from yellow, orange, gold, and green-brown can be obtained. Without mordant, a yellow colour is produced.",
    "Research": "In laboratory experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit bodies have been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68 mg per 100 g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74 mg/100 g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts have been shown to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.\nPolish studies found that although the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed that I. badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect is caused by a brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites."

  "Inonotus obliquus": {
    "Introduction": "Inonotus obliquus, commonly called chaga (; a Latinization of the Russian word ча́га), is a fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae. It is parasitic on birch and other trees. The sterile conk is irregularly formed and resembles burnt charcoal. It is not the fruiting body of the fungus, but a sclerotium or mass of mycelium, mostly black because of a substantial amount of melanin. It is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement for various health benefits but lacks sufficient scientific evidence for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.",
    "Description": "Inonotus obliquus causes a white heart rot to develop in the host tree. The chaga spores enter the tree through wounds, particularly poorly healed branch stubs. The white rot decay will spread throughout the heartwood of the host. During the infection cycle, penetration of the sapwood occurs only around the sterile exterior mycelium mass. The chaga fungus will continue to cause decay within the living tree for 10–80+ years. While the tree is alive, only sterile mycelial masses are produced (the black exterior conk). The sexual stage begins after the tree, or some portion of the tree, is killed by the infection. I. obliquus will begin to produce fertile fruiting bodies underneath the bark. These bodies begin as a whitish mass that turn to brown with time. Since the sexual stage occurs almost entirely under the bark, the fruiting body is rarely seen. These fruiting bodies produce basidiospores which will spread the infection to other vulnerable trees.\nThe mycelial canker is about 10–25 centimetres (4–10 in) wide, while the underlying crust can be 5–50 cm (2–19+1⁄2 in) long.",
    "Chemistry": "The black sclerotium has large concentrations of melanin. Chaga contains extremely high concentrations of oxalate, 2800–11200 mg total oxalates/100 g sclerotium, one of the highest reported in any organism.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include Apiosporina morbosa, Diplodia tumefaciens, and Echinodontium tinctorium, as well as species of Fulvifomes and Fomitiporia.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Inonotus obliquus is found most commonly in the Circumboreal Region of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is distributed in birch forests.\nGenerally found growing on birch (Betula spp.) trees, it has also been found on alder (Alnus spp.), beech (Fagus spp.) and poplar (Populus spp.).",
    "Cultivation": "Attempts at cultivating this fungus on potato dextrose agar and other simulated media resulted in a reduced and markedly different production of metabolites. Cultivated chaga developed a reduced number of phytosterols, particularly lanosterol, an intermediate in the synthesis of ergosterol and lanostane-type triterpenes.",
    "Uses": "It is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement for various health benefits but lacks sufficient scientific evidence for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.\nChaga is traditionally grated into a fine powder and used to brew a beverage resembling coffee or tea which tastes strongly of Chinese herbal tea. However, caution is warranted with chronic use due to the extremely high concentrations of oxalates in chaga.\nHot water extraction is a common preparation. A decoction is created by simmering blocklike pieces of the chaga in numerous quarts of water until the water is reduced and the remaining liquid contains a portion of the chaga's concentrated water-soluble compounds. Such preparations, produced in China and Japan, are exported worldwide. The β-D-glucans may have a content of approximately 35% in a pure extract. If chaga tea is prepared at home, the chaga chunks can be reused multiple times.\nPotawatomi people use the fungus, called shkitagen in their language, as a firekeeping tinder. According to Potawatomi biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer, \"Once an ember meets shkitagen it will not go out but smolders slowly in the fungal matrix, holding its heat. Even the smallest spark, so fleeting and easily lost, will be held and nurtured if it lands on a cube of shkitagen.\"",
    "Common names": "The name chaga comes from the Russian name of the fungus, ча́га, čága, which in turn is borrowed from the word for \"mushroom\" in Komi, тшак, tšak, the language of the indigenous peoples in the Kama River Basin, west of the Ural Mountains. It is also known as the clinker polypore, cinder conk, black mass and birch canker polypore. In England and officially in Canada, it is known as the sterile conk trunk rot of birch."

  "Ischnoderma resinosum": {
    "Introduction": "Ischnoderma resinosum is a species of fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae. It is commonly known as the resinous polypore, late fall polypore, or benzoin bracket.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally described as Boletus resinosus in 1794 by German botanist Heinrich Schrader. It has acquired an extensive synonymy in its taxonomic history, having been juggled between several genera. Petter Karsten transferred it to Ischnoderma in 1879 to give it the name by which it is currently known.",
    "Description": "This shelf mushroom is 7–30 cm (3–12 in) across, velvety, dark red/brown, darkening and forming zones in age. The whitish to brownish flesh is watery when young and corky with age. It is sweet smelling. \nIschnoderma benzoinum is similar and has darker flesh.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "This fungus fruits on hardwood logs and stumps in autumn. A widely distributed species, it has been recorded from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America.",
    "Uses": "Young, soft specimens may be cooked and eaten, but the species becomes hard and unpalatable in age."

  "Kuehneromyces mutabilis": {
    "Introduction": "Kuehneromyces mutabilis (synonym: Pholiota mutabilis), commonly known as the sheathed woodtuft, is a species of fungus that grows in clumps on dead wood. It is edible but strongly resembles the deadly poisonous Galerina marginata.",
    "Description": "The clustered shiny convex caps grow up to 8 centimetres (3+1⁄4 in) in diameter. They are very hygrophanous; in a damp state they are shiny and greasy with a deep orange-brown colour towards the rim; often there is a disc of lighter (less sodden) flesh in the middle. In a dry state they are cinnamon-coloured.\nThe gills are initially light then brown and are sometimes somewhat decurrent. The spore print is rusty brown.\nThe stipe is 4–9 cm long and under 1 cm in diameter with a ring which separates the bare, smooth light cinnamon upper part from the darker brown shaggily scaly lower part.  This type of stem is sometimes described as \"booted\".",
    "Similar species": "It resembles the deadly poisonous Galerina marginata. Although a typical K. mutabilis is easily distinguished from a typical G. marginata by the \"booted\" stipe which is shaggy below the ring, this character is not reliable and G. marginata can also have scales. The main differences are:\n\nWhile they are both hygrophanous, K. mutabilis dries from the centre outwards (so having  a lighter colour in the centre) and G. marginata dries from the edge inwards.\nthe stem below the ring is scaly below the ring in K. mutabilis, but normally fibrously silky in G. marginata.\nK. mutabilis has a  pleasant mushroom smell and mild taste, whereas G. marginata tastes and smells mealy.\nAlso similar are K. lignicola, K. marginellus, Pholiota angustipes and P. terrestris.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Kuehneromyces mutabilis is found in North America, Australia, Asia (in the Caucuses, Siberia, and Japan), and Europe. In Europe, it can be found from Southern Europe to Iceland and Scandinavia.\nThis species always grows on wood, generally on stumps of broad-leaved trees (especially beech, birch and alder), and rarely on conifers.\nIt is found from April to late October, and also in the remaining winter months where conditions are mild.  It is often seen at times when there are few other fungi in evidence.",
    "Edibility": "Some guides caution that K. mutabilis is not safe to consume as it could be confused with the deadly poisonous Galerina marginata, even by people who are quite knowledgeable.\nThe caps of this mushroom can be fried or used for flavouring in sauces and soups (the stems being too tough to eat). The flavour is best after cooking."

The gills are purple and the spore print is white. It can resemble species such as L. trullisata (found in sand), Cortinarius torvus, and C. lucorum.\nFound under hardwood and conifers east of the Rocky Mountains from July to October, L. ochropurpurea produces an edible mushroom."

  "Lactarius deliciosus": {
    "Introduction": "Lactarius deliciosus, commonly known as the delicious milk cap, saffron milk cap, or red pine mushroom, is one of the best-known members of the large milk-cap genus Lactarius in the order Russulales. It is native to Europe, but has been accidentally introduced to other countries along with pine trees, with which the fungus is symbiotic.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was known to Carl Linnaeus, who officially described it in the second volume of his Species Plantarum in 1753, giving it the name Agaricus deliciosus. The specific epithet is derived from Latin deliciosus, meaning \"tasty\". The Swedish taxonomist allegedly gave the species its epithet after smelling it and presuming it tasted good, perhaps confusing it with a Mediterranean milk cap regarded for its flavor. Dutch mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon added the varietal epithet lactifluus in 1801, before English mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray placed it in its current genus, Lactarius, in 1821 in his The Natural Arrangement of British Plants.\nIt is commonly known as saffron milk-cap, red pine mushroom, or simply pine mushroom in English. An alternative North American name is orange latex milky. Its Spanish name varies (níscalo, nícalo, robellón...). Its Catalan name is rovelló (pl. rovellons). In the Girona area, it is called a pinetell (in Catalan) because it is collected near wild pine trees; it is typically harvested in October following the late August rains. Both this and L. deterrimus are known as \"kanlıca\", \"çıntar\" or \"çam melkisi\" in Turkey. In Romania, it is known as Rascovi and it can be found in the northern regions in autumn season.",
    "Description": "Lactarius deliciosus has a carrot-orange cap that is convex to vase shaped, inrolled when young, 3 to 20 centimetres (1 to 8 inches) across, often with darker orange lines in the form of concentric circles. The cap is sticky and viscid when wet, but is often dry. It has crowded decurrent gills and a squat orange stipe that is often hollow, 2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in) long and 1 to 2.5 cm (1⁄2 to 1 in) thick. The flesh and gills stain a deep green color when handled. When fresh, it exudes an orange-red latex that does not change color. The spore print is cream-coloured.",
    "Chemistry": "When grown in liquid culture, the mycelium produces a mixture of fatty acids and various compounds such as chroman-4-one, anofinic acid, 3-hydroxyacetylindole, ergosterol, and cyclic dipeptides.",
    "Similar species": "The mushroom is similar to L. rubrilacteus, which stains blue and exudes a red latex. It also resembles L. olympianus, which has white latex and tastes unpleasant. Additionally, L. thyinos is orange but does not stain greenish, and L. salmoneus has a white cap.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "L. deliciosus grows under conifers on acidic soils and forms a mycorrhizal relationship with its host tree. It is native to the southern Pyrenees where it grows under Mediterranean pines, as well as throughout the Mediterranean basin in Portugal, Bulgaria, Spain, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, France and elsewhere. Both this fungus and L. deterrimus are collected and sold in the İzmir Province of southwestern Turkey, and the Antalya Province of the south coast. In the island of Cyprus, large numbers of L. deliciosus are found in the high altitude Pinus nigra and P. brutia forests of the Troodos mountain range, where locals hunt them with vigour, as this fungus is highly esteemed among the local delicacies.\nAfter analysing DNA from collections around the world, mycologists Jorinde Nuytinck, Annemieke Verbeken, and Steve Miller have concluded that L. deliciosus is a distinct European species that differs genetically, morphologically, and ecologically from populations in North America or Central America. It has been reportedly introduced to Chile, Australia and New Zealand, where it grows in Pinus radiata plantations. The species has also been introduced to South Africa. In Australia, popular places for collecting this mushroom, especially among the Polish community, are around Macedon in Victoria, Mount Crawford in the Adelaide Hills and in the Oberon area in New South Wales, Australia, where they can grow to the size of a dinner plate, and in the pine forests of the Australian Capital Territory. Many people of Italian, Polish, Ukrainian and other eastern European ancestry in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, Australia travel to collect these mushrooms after autumn rainfall around Easter time.\nPine plantations and Siberian pine forests are favourable habitats for this species.\nIt can also be found in Argentina (\"níscalo\"), Chile (\"callampa rosada\") and Uruguay (\"hongo delicioso\", or \"hongo catalán\").",
    "Uses": "L. deliciosus is an edible mushroom, but may taste mild or bitter; its misleading epithet, deliciosus ('delicious'), may have been caused by Linnaeus mistaking it for another species. The mushrooms are collected from August to early October, traditionally being salted or pickled. High consumption of the species may cause urine to discolor to orange or red.\nIt is widely collected in the Iberian Peninsula. It is used in Spanish cuisine. One recipe recommends they should be lightly washed, fried whole cap down in olive oil with a small amount of garlic and served drenched in raw olive oil and parsley. Only a very small amount of butter is recommended in the pan.\nThis mushroom is also very popular in Russia, usually salted.\nFurther north and east it is a feature of Provençal cuisine. They are also collected in Poland, where they are traditionally served fried in butter, with cream, or marinated. In Cyprus, saffron milk caps are usually grilled on the charcoal and then dressed in olive oil and lemon or bitter orange, they are sauteed with onions, or sometimes stewed with onions, coriander and red wine. In Russian cuisine these mushrooms are traditionally preserved by salting.\nIn India, the fungus is one of the ten most widely consumed mushrooms by indigenous tribes of Meghalaya.",
    "Culture": "A fresco in the Roman town of Herculaneum appears to depict L. deliciosus and is one of the earliest pieces of art to illustrate a fungus.",

  "Lactarius torminosus": {
    "Introduction": "Lactarius torminosus, commonly known as the woolly milkcap or the bearded milkcap, is a large species of agaric fungus. It was first described scientifically by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774 as an Agaricus, and later transferred to the genus Lactarius in 1821 by Samuel Frederick Gray. L. torminosus officially became the type species of Lactarius in 2011 after molecular studies prompted the taxonomic reshuffling of species between several Russulaceae genera.\nThe caps are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to 10 cm (4 in). A blend of pink and ochre hues, the cap sometimes has concentric zones of alternating lighter and darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inward, and shaggy when young. On the underside of the cap are narrow flesh-colored gills that are crowded closely together. The cylindrical stem is a pale flesh color with a delicately downy surface and brittle flesh; it is up to 8 cm (3 in) long and 0.6–2 cm (1⁄4–3⁄4 in) thick. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a bitter white latex that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety nordmanensis, in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow. Similar species like L. pubescens or L. villosus differ in morphology and coloration, as well as microscopic characteristics like spore shape and size.\nA common and widely distributed species, L. torminosus mushrooms form on the ground singly or in groups in mixed forests of both the Old World and North America. A mycorrhizal species, it associates with various trees, most commonly birch. The species is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. It is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten in Russia and Finland. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.",
    "Taxonomy": "German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer was the first to describe the species, placing it in the genus Agaricus in 1774. Seven years later in 1781, Jean Bulliard described a species he called Agaricus necator and illustrated it in the first volume of his Herbier de la France; this name and the synonym Lactarius necator, resulting from Christian Hendrik Persoon's 1800 transfer to Lactarius, are both considered to refer to L. torminosus. Otto Kuntze, for his part chose to put it in Lactifluus, while Paul Kummer thought Galorrheus was the appropriate placement; until the recent resurrection of Lactifluus, both genera had been long considered to be unnecessary segregates of Lactarius. According to Index Fungorum, another synonym is Samuel Frederick Gray's Lactarius necans. Gray also gave the species its modern name when he transferred it to Lactarius in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants.\nAccording to Hesler and Smith's 1979 classification of the genus Lactarius, L. torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L. torminosus falls into a group that includes L. torminosulus, and that these two species are closely related to a group that includes L. tesquorum, L. scoticus, and L. pubescens.\nA multi-gene molecular analysis published in 2008 demonstrated that species then distributed in the genera Lactarius and Russula actually consisted of four distinct lineages. The subsequent reorganization of Russulaceae species—a taxonomic change needed to make Russula and Lactarius monophyletic—required that a new type species be defined for Lactarius, since the previous type, L. piperatus, belonged to the clade that will be transferred to genus Lactifluus. A proposal to conserve Lactarius with L. torminosus as the type was accepted by the Nomenclatural Committee for Fungi and passed at the 2011 International Botanical Congress. The change minimizes \"taxonomic disruption\", allowing most of the common and well-known Lactarius species to retain their names.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet torminosus means \"tormenting\" or \"causing colic\", in reference to the gastrointestinal distress associated with consuming the raw mushroom. Early English vernacular names were Gray's \"bellyach milk-stool\" (1821), and James Edward Smith's \"bearded pepper agaric\" (1824). More recent common names include \"shaggy milkcap\", \"powderpuff milkcap\", \"pink-fringed milkcap\", \"bearded milkcap\", and the British Mycological Society-recommended \"woolly milkcap\".",
    "Description": "The cap is initially convex, but as it matures the center forms a depression and the outer edges rise until it assumes the shape of a shallow funnel; its final width is typically between 2 and 12 cm (3⁄4 and 4+3⁄4 in). The cap margin is strongly curled inward; when young, it is tomentose (covered with a thick matting of hairs), forming a veil-like structure that partly covers up the gills. This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly tomentose, but eventually, the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth. The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a zonate pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity. The cap color is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored flesh is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The latex that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills. It has an acrid taste, with a slight to pungent odor.\n\nThe gills are subdecurrent (running only a small way down the length of the stem), close to crowded together, narrow, and sometimes forked near the stem. Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult stem is 1.5–8 cm (1⁄2–3 in) long, 0.6–2 cm (1⁄4–3⁄4 in) thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to pruinose (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish-orange to orange-white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem is firm, beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow. Occasionally, white mycelium is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.\nThe fruit body formation of L. torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In this type of development, the hymenium forms early on the underside of the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "The spore print of L. torminosus is cream to pale yellow, and the spores 8–10.2 by 5.8–6.6 μm, roughly spherical to broadly elliptical in side view, and hyaline (translucent). Only the ornamentation on their surface is amyloid; it is partially reticulate (network-like) with interrupted ridges roughly 0.5–0.7 μm high, and a few isolated warts. Spores have a conspicuous apiculus, demarcating where it was once attached to the basidia via the sterigma. The basidia are four-spored, hyaline and club-shaped to cylindrical, measuring 30–47.7 by 7.3–8.2 μm.\nPleurocystidia are present only in the form of macrocystidia embedded and originating in the hymenium and just below it, they reach 40.3–80.0 by 5.1–9.5 μm. Macrocystidia are abundant in the hymenium. Characterized by their spindle-shaped to ventricose (swollen on one side) form that gradually tapers in width, they have granular hyaline contents. Gill edge cystidia (cheilocystidia) are smaller: 30–52 by 4.5–8.0 μm. The cap cuticle is made of gelatinized, interwoven hyphae arranged more or less parallel to the cap surface (a form known as ixocutis); the thin-walled, threadlike hyphae of this layer are 2.5–7.3 μm wide.",
    "Variety nordmanensis": "Lactarius nordmanensis was described by Alexander Smith in 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling L. torminosus in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9–11 by 6.5–8 μm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of L. torminosus, L. nordmanensis has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow. Hesler and Smith reduced L. nordmanensis to the status of a variety under L. torminosus in 1979. Lactarius torminosus var. nordmanensis has been recorded from California, Idaho, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the United States, Quebec in Canada, and Switzerland. The variety resembles Lactarius pubescens var. betulae, but differs in its longer pleurocystidia, larger spores with slightly different spore ornamentation, and strongly burning acrid taste. The holotype specimen of L. torminosus var. nordmanensis was collected by Smith in 1956 near Nordman, Idaho.",
    "Similar species": "The woolly cap margin, pinkish tones in the cap, acrid latex, and association with birch are reliable field characteristics to help identify L. torminosus. However, there are several hairy Lactarius species with which it is often confused, and sometimes examination of microscopic characteristics is necessary to distinguish between them. The closely related L. torminosulus is a dwarf version of L. torminosus, an arctic species associated with the birches Betula nana or B. glandulosa. Immature fruit bodies of L. scrobiculatus resemble L. torminosus, but they have a white latex that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air, and their stems have shiny depressed spots. The caps of the poorly known species L. cilicioides are not zonate, and its spores are smaller. L. pubescens is physically quite similar, but can be distinguished by its paler color and smaller spores (6.0–7.5 by 5.0–6.5 μm). L. controversus has a cap margin that is not as hairy, whitish to cream-colored gills, and larger spores measuring 7.5–10 by 6–7.5 μm. L. mairei has a coloration similar to L. torminosus, but is rarer and typically found associated with oak trees on calcareous soil. Known only from North Carolina and western Canada, L. subtorminosus was named for its similarity to L. torminosus. It can be distinguished by its mild-tasting latex and smaller, roughly spherical spores measuring 5.5–7 by 5.5–6.5 μm. In North America, L. psammicola grows with eastern hardwoods and L. subvillosus appears in tanoak-madrone woodland.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Lactarius torminosus is found in northern temperate and boreal climates, penetrating sometimes into subarctic regions. It has been recorded from North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and is common in North America, where it sometimes grows with aspen (Populus species). The North American distribution extends north into the Yukon and Alaska and south to Mexico.",
    "Ecology": "Lactarius torminosus is a mycorrhizal species, and as such plays an important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of mycelium on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.",
    "Toxicity": "The intensely peppery taste of the raw mushroom can blister the tongue if sampled in excess. Some authors have reported the species as outright poisonous, or causing \"mild to fatal gastroenteritis\". In a 1930 publication, Hans Steidle reported that although the mushroom was not toxic to \"unicellular and cold-blooded organisms\" when ingested, the liquid extract and the pressed juice of the fruit bodies, when injected under the skin of a frog, resulted in disturbed breathing, paralysis, and eventually death. Symptoms that are typically experienced after consuming raw mushrooms include nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea starting about one hour after ingestion. This combination can lead to dehydration, muscle spasms, and circulatory collapse. The gastroenteritis will usually resolve without treatment in a couple of days.",
    "Uses": "Despite the reports of toxicity, L. torminosus mushrooms are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after which they are valued for their peppery taste. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.20%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.09%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.01%.",
    "Chemistry": "The compound thought to be responsible for the toxicity of raw L. torminosus is the pungent-tasting velleral present at a concentration of 0.16 mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a breakdown product of stearyl-velutinal. Broken lactifers—specialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex—leak the precursor chemicals whose breakdown products act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type sesquiterpene lactone 15-hydroxyblennin A is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various Lactarius species, such as blennin A in L. deliciosus and L. blennius, and lactarorufin N in Lactarius rufus. Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to defend against predation, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in medicinal chemistry.\nFruit bodies of L. torminosus contain a number of sterols, of which ergosterol (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds that contribute to the odor of the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.",

  "Lactarius turpis": {
    "Introduction": "Lactarius turpis (also L. plumbeus or L. necator) is a Eurasian species of fungus, commonly known as the ugly milk-cap in English. \nIts messy, dirty appearance is characteristic of the species and gives it its English name and the Latin species epithet, turpis. It seems to collect debris on top and the gills acquire a dirty brownish stain due to discoloured milk.",
    "Taxonomy": "This very variable mushroom demonstrates a common phenomenon in mycology as there is much disagreement over naming. The three main scientific designations:\n\nLactarius turpis Fr.,\nLactarius necator (Bull.:Fr.) Karsten, and\nLactarius plumbeus (Bull.:Fr.) S. F. Gray,\nare usually, but not always, considered to be synonyms for same species. The epithets necator and plumbeus were both coined by  Pierre Bulliard as Agaricus necator (1791) and Agaricus plumbeus (1793), but there is and was confusion as to which mushrooms were meant. The name turpis, derived from the Latin term turpis \"ugly\", was originated by  Johann Anton Weinmann and taken over by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838.\nPlumbeus too referred to the milk-cap's appearance, derived from the Latin for plumbeus \"lead-coloured\".",
    "Description": "The cap is normally 4–20 cm (1.5–8 in) in diameter. At first it has an involute margin and a somewhat depressed centre. The upper surface is olive brown or yellow-green and is often sticky or slimy in the middle. When young it has velvety zones and may be shaggy at the rim. Later it becomes funnel-shaped and the colour darkens to blackish. The gills are crowded, dirty white, stained olive-brown by old milk, which is initially white on contact with the air. They are somewhat decurrent. With potassium hydroxide or ammonia there is a purple reaction.\nThe stipe is up to about 7 cm (2+3⁄4 in) tall by 3 cm (1+1⁄4 in) in diameter and it is similar in colour to the cap, but much lighter. It may have shallow pits (scrobiculae). The flesh is a dirty white and tends to turn brown. The taste (especially the abundant milk) is acrid. There is little smell. The spores are about 7x6 μ and are ornamented with a pattern of ridges. The spore print is cream in colour.",
    "Similar species": "A similar species in Pacific Northwest conifer forests, as well as Sitka spruce forests, is L. olivaceoumbrinus. Usually found growing individually, it has a stronger olive-brown colour on its cap and stipe, with dark spots on the latter. Also similar is L. atroviridis.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Lactarius turpis is found naturally in Europe and Siberia, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. It can also be found in North America, in the northeast (July–September) and near the West Coast (September–November). While especially associated with birch, it is also found with spruce, pine and other trees in mixed woodland.",
    "Edibility": "This species contains the mutagenic chemical compound necatorin, so it cannot be recommended for eating. Boiling reduces the concentration of this compound, but does not effectively eliminate it.\nProbably due to the acrid taste, most western European authorities classify this mushroom as inedible or poor.  However, it has popularly been used (after boiling) as a spice in mushroom dishes in northern and eastern Europe and Siberia (see Mushroom picking in Slavic culture). It is commercially available preserved in salt. Considered a choice mushroom in Russia, one of the best for pickling (salt only, no vinegar)."

  "Laetiporus sulphureus": {
    "Introduction": "Laetiporus sulphureus is a species of bracket fungus (fungi that grow on trees). Its common names include sulphur polypore, sulphur shelf, and chicken-of-the-woods. Its fruit bodies grow as striking golden-yellow shelf-like structures on tree trunks and branches. Old fruitbodies fade to pale beige or pale grey. The undersurface of the fruit body is made up of tubelike pores rather than gills.\nFound in Europe and North America, L. sulphureus is a saprophyte and occasionally a weak parasite, causing brown cubical rot in the heartwood of trees on which it grows. Unlike many bracket fungi, it is edible when young, although adverse reactions have been reported.",
    "Taxonomy": "Laetiporus sulphureus was first described as Boletus sulphureus by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1789. It has had many synonyms and was finally given its current name in 1920 by American mycologist William Murrill. Laetiporus means \"with bright pores\" and sulphureus means \"the colour of sulphur\".\nInvestigations in North America have shown that there are several similar species within what has been considered L. sulphureus and that the true L. sulphureus may be restricted to regions east of the Rocky Mountains. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and nuclear large subunit and mitochondrial small subunit rDNA sequences from North American collections have delineated five distinct clades within the core Laetiporus clade. Sulphureus clade I contains white-pored L. sulphureus isolates, while Sulphureus clade II contains yellow-pored L. sulphureus isolates.",
    "Description": "The fruiting body emerges directly from the trunk of a tree and is initially knob-shaped, but soon expands to fan-shaped shelves, typically growing in overlapping tiers. It is sulphur-yellow to bright orange in color and has a suedelike texture. Old fruitbodies fade to tan or whitish. Each shelf may be anywhere from 5 to 60 centimetres (2 to 23+1⁄2 inches) across and up to 4–12 cm (1+1⁄2–4+1⁄2 in) thick. The fertile surface is sulphur-yellow with small pores or tubes and produces a white spore print. When fresh, the flesh is succulent with a strong fungal aroma and exudes a yellowish, transparent juice, but soon becomes dry and brittle.\nAlthough fairly distinct, it can resemble Laetiporus persicinus.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Laetiporus sulphureus is widely distributed across Europe (April to November) and North America, although its range may be restricted to areas east of the Rockies. It grows on dead or mature hardwoods and has been reported from a very wide variety of host trees, such as Quercus, Prunus, Pyrus, Populus,  Salix, Robinia, and Fagus, occasionally also from conifers, from August to October or later, sometimes as early as June. In the Mediterranean region, this species is usually found on Ceratonia and Eucalyptus. It can usually be found growing in clusters.",
    "Parasitism": "The fungus causes brown cubical rot of heartwood in the roots, tree base and stem. After infection, the wood is at first discolored yellowish to red but subsequently becomes reddish-brown and brittle. At the final stages of decay, the wood can be rubbed like powder between the fingers.",
    "Guinness world record": "A specimen weighing 45 kilograms (100 lb) was found in the New Forest, Hampshire, United Kingdom, on 15 October 1990.",
    "Ecology": "Certain species of deer consume this type of mushroom.",
    "Cultivation": "Compared with species such as Agaricus bisporus (Swiss Brown mushroom) and the oyster mushroom, commercial cultivation of Laetiporus occurs at a much smaller and less mechanized scale.",
    "Uses": "Due to its taste, Laetiporus sulphureus has been called the chicken polypore and chicken-of-the-woods (not to be confused with Grifola frondosa, the so-called hen-of-the-woods).\nMany people think that the mushroom tastes like crab or lobster leading to the nickname lobster-of-the-woods. The authors of Mushrooms in Color said that the mushroom tastes good sauteed in butter or prepared in a cream sauce served on toast or rice. It is highly regarded in Germany and North America.\nYoung specimens are edible if they exude large amounts of a clear to pale yellow watery liquid. Only the young outer edges of larger specimens should be collected, as older portions tend to be tough, unpalatable, and bug-infested. The mushroom should not be eaten raw.",
    "Adverse effects": "Some people have experienced gastrointestinal upset after eating this mushroom, and it should not be consumed raw.\nSevere adverse reactions can occur, including vomiting and fever, in about 10% of the population, but this is now thought to be the result of confusion with morphologically similar species such as Laetiporus huroniensis, which grows on hemlock trees, and L. gilbertsonii, which grows on Eucalyptus.",
    "Bioactivity": "The fungus produces the Laetiporus sulphureus lectin (LSL), which exhibits haemolytic and haemagglutination activities. Haemolytic lectins are sugar-binding proteins that lyse and agglutinate cells. These biochemical activities are promoted when bound to carbohydrates."

  "Leccinum albostipitatum": {
    "Introduction": "Leccinum albostipitatum is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. This large, orange-capped mushroom forms beneficial relationships with poplar trees across Europe. First described scientifically in 2005, it was previously confused with similar orange species but can be distinguished by its white stipe with fine scales that darken with age and its flesh that changes colour when cut. The mushroom grows in poplar stands and mixed forests throughout Scandinavia and mountainous areas of central Europe.",
    "Taxonomy": "Leccinum albostipitatum was scientifically described by the mycologists Hendrik den Bakker and Machiel Noordeloos in 2005, following comparison of Populus‑associated collections previously identified as Leccinum aurantiacum or Leccinum leucopodium. The holotype (M.E. Noordeloos 96134, herbarium L) was gathered on 10 September 1996 at Monte Bella, Trento, Italy. Morphological characters of stipe ornamentation and cap colour distinguished it from related European taxa.",
    "Description": "The cap reaches 80–250 mm in diameter and is hemispherical when young, maturing to convex or plano‑convex. Its surface is finely tomentose and fibrillose, displaying a vivid orange that may fade toward the margin in older fruit‑bodies and often cracks slightly with age. The stipe measures 50–270 mm in length and 15–50 mm in thickness, initially whitish and densely clothed in fine white squamules that darken to light brown in mature specimens; handling typically induces a clear blue bruise. The flesh is white in the stipe base but turns vinaceous to greyish‑black when cut in the cap. Tubes are 9–30 mm deep, adnate to slightly decurrent, with pores about 0.5 mm wide that bruise brown. Microscopically, spores measure (9.5–)11.0–17.0 by 4.0–5.5 μm, spindle-shaped (fusiform) with a conical apex and shallow suprahilar depression. Basidia are 25–35 by 7.5–11.0 μm and four‑spored. Hymenial cystidia measure 20–45 by 7–10 μm (lageniform). The cap cutical (pileipellis) is a cutis of narrow cylindrical elements (35–80 by 4.0–15.5 μm) that appear yellowish‑brown in water. Caulocystidia are 15–65 by 10.0–16.0 μm, clavate to fusiform. Clamp connections are absent.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Leccinum albostipitatum grows solitary or in groups (gregariously) in mixed forests and poplar stands, strictly in ectomycorrhizal association with Populus species. It is not recorded from the Netherlands but is common in Scandinavia and the montane regions of central Europe, becoming rare at lower altitudes. Known localities include Monte Bella, Italy, Sommauthe/Beaumont-en-Argonne (Champagne-Ardenne, France), and Sogndal (Vestland, Norway).\n\n\nReferences"

  "Leccinum aurantiacum": {
    "Introduction": "Leccinum aurantiacum is a species of fungus in the genus Leccinum. It has a large, characteristically red-capped fruiting body. In North America, it is sometimes referred to by the common name red-capped scaber stalk.\nThe species is usually attributed to forests of Europe and North America, but North American specimens may actually belong to other species. It is usually considered edible, but must be cooked thoroughly and may be unsafe for some.",
    "Description": "The cap is orange-red and measures 5–15 centimetres (2–6 inches) across. Its flesh is white, bruising at first burgundy, then grayish or purple-black. The underside of the cap has very small, whitish pores that bruise olive-brown. The stem measures 8–16 cm (3–6+1⁄2 in) tall and 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) thick and can bruise blue-green. It is whitish, with short, rigid projections or scabers that turn to brown to black with age.",
    "Similar species": "In Europe, several orange-red capped species exist, which differ mainly in habitat. L. albostipitatum grows with aspen and has white scales on the stipe. In coniferous forests, L. vulpinum occurs around pine and spruce trees. Not all authors recognise these as distinct species.\nIn North America, L. insigne grows in aspen or birch stands, while L. atrostipitatum grows in birch stands. Both are edible. Another similar species is L. versipelle.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "L. aurantiacum can be found fruiting during summer and autumn in forests throughout Europe and North America. The association between fungus and host tree is mycorrhizal. In Europe, it has traditionally been associated with poplar trees. L. aurantiacum is found among oak and various other deciduous trees, including beech, birch, chestnut, willow, and trees of the genus Tilia. L. aurantiacum is not known to associate with conifers in Europe.\nNorth American populations have been recorded in coniferous and deciduous forests, though it is uncertain whether collections from coniferous forests are actually L. vulpinum. Additionally, collections from deciduous forests have been attributed to other North American species such as L. insigne and L. brunneum, so L. aurantiacum may be absent altogether from North America.",
    "Edibility": "This is a favorite species for eating and can be prepared as other edible boletes. Its flesh turns very dark on cooking. Like most members of the Boletaceae, these mushrooms are targeted by maggots. Due to a number of poisonings and the difficulty identifying species, Leccinum species are considered by some as possibly not safe to eat. This species also needs to be cooked well (not parboiled) or else it may cause vomiting or other negative effects. Some report gastrointestinal upset after eating this species. At least one death has been reported that was linked to consuming this species."

  "Leccinum scabrum": {
    "Introduction": "Leccinum scabrum, commonly known as the birch bolete, rough-stemmed bolete, or scaber stalk, is a species of fungus in the family Boletaceae. It was formerly classified as Boletus scaber.\nThe birch bolete is widespread in Europe, in the Himalayas in Asia, and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring only in mycorrhizal association with birch trees. This mushroom is also becoming increasingly common in Australia and New Zealand where it is likely introduced. It is an edible mushroom if only firm specimens are used and cooked thoroughly.",
    "Description": "The cap is 4–10 cm (1+1⁄2–4 in) wide and convex before flattening. The skin of the cap is tan or brownish, usually with a lighter edge; it is smooth, bald, and dry to viscid.\nThe pores are whitish at a young age, later gray. In older specimens, the pores on the pileus can bulge out, while around the stipe they dent in strongly. The pore covering is easy to remove from the skin of the pileus. The spore print is brown. The spores measure 13–16 by 4–4.5 μm and are elliptical.\nThe stipe is 5–15 cm (2–6 in) long and 1–3.5 cm (3⁄8–1+3⁄8 in) wide and slim, with white and dark to black flakes; it tapers upward. The basic mycelium is white.\nThe flesh is whitish, sometimes darkening following exposure. In young specimens, the meat is relatively firm, but it very soon becomes spongy and holds water, especially in rainy weather. When cooked, the meat turns black.",
    "Similar species": "Several different species of Leccinum mushrooms are found in mycorrhiza with birches, and can be confused by amateurs and mycologists alike. L. holopus is paler and whitish in all parts. L. alaskanum, common with birch in Alaska, has a dark and light, streaked or mottled cap. L. variicolor has a bluish stipe. L. oxydabile has firmer, pinkish flesh and a different pileus skin structure.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Leccinum scabrum is a European species that has been introduced to various areas of the world, mostly appearing in urban areas. In New Zealand, it associates solely with Betula pendula. In North America, it can be found from June to September, except on the West Coast, where it appears from September to November.\nIt grows in association with birch. It has been found in association with ornamental birch trees planted outside of its native range, such as in California.",
    "Edibility": "The species is edible when firm, but some guides consider it unworthwhile. It can be cooked in various mushroom dishes or be pickled in brine or vinegar. It is commonly harvested for food in Finland and Russia."

  "Leccinum versipelle": {
    "Introduction": "Leccinum versipelle, also known as Boletus testaceoscaber, dark-stalked bolete, or orange birch bolete, is a common species of mushroom that may be edible when given the right preparation. It is found below birches from July through to November, and turns black when cooked.",
    "Taxonomy": "Leccinum is a genus of fungi in the family Boletaceae. It was the name given first to a series of fungi within the genus Boletus, then erected as a new genus last century. Their main distinguishing feature is the small, rigid projections (scabers) that give a rough texture to their stalks. The genus name was coined from the Italian Leccino, for a type of rough-stemmed bolete.",
    "Description": "The cap is broadly convex, buff to yellow-orange or ochre, bright red-brown or brick red. It is felty and grows up to 15 centimetres (6 in) in diameter. The flesh is white to pink, when cut staining reddish and then changing to avellaneous and finally fuscous. Tubes are 8 - 22 mm long, yellowish white to brownish grey, violaceous to greyish when bruised. Pores measure 0.5 mm in diameter, greyish white to grey ochre, discolouring brownish when bruised. \nThe stipe is firm, long and slender, white, lightly to densely covered with fine (sometimes on the stipe base more coarse) greyish to blackish, sometimes whitish, squamules. Stalks are up to 15 cm tall by 3.5 cm wide, whitish, and with many raised, black dots.  \nThe spores are brown, or smokey to blackish-brown, fusiform, (9.0—) 11.5—16.5 x 3.5—4.0(—5.0) μm. Spore print is yellow-brown to olive.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Leccinum versipelle fruits on the ground solitary or gregarious, with ectomycorrhizal association with Betula in forests and heathland, on sandy, slightly acidic, loamy soils. It can be found across Europe from August to November.",
    "Edibility": "Leccinum versipelle is edible cooked. It is mildly toxic (causing nausea and vomiting) unless given proper heat treatment: frying or boiling for 15–20 minutes is necessary. It is commonly harvested for food in Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, southeast Alaska and Russia."

  "Lepista nuda": {
    "Introduction": "Collybia nuda, commonly known as the blewit or wood blewit and previously described as Lepista nuda and Clitocybe nuda, is a species of fungi. Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790, it was also known as Tricholoma nudum for many years. It is morphologically similar and related to the field blewit, Collybia personata; both mushrooms were reassigned to the genus Collybia in 2023.\nThe species is native to Europe and North America. It is found in both coniferous and deciduous woodlands. It has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France. It is a widely consumed edible mushroom.",
    "Taxonomy": "The French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described the wood blewit in his work Herbier de la France in 1790 as Agaricus nudus, reporting that it was common in the woods all year. He wrote of two varieties: one whose gills and cap are initially light violet and mature to burgundy, while the other has wine-coloured gills that intensify in colour with age. He added that the first variety was often confused with Cortinarius violaceus, though it has a \"nude\" cap and no spidery web veil unlike the other species.  English naturalist James Bolton gave it the name Agaricus bulbosa—the bulbous agaric—in his An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax in 1791. He noted that it was rare in the region, though had found some in Ovenden.\nGerman mycologist Paul Kummer placed it in the genus Tricholoma in 1871, the same year that English botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke placed it in Lepista. It was known by these names for many years, with some authors accepting Lepista and while others retained the wood blewit in Tricholoma. In 1969 Howard E. Bigelow and Alexander H. Smith reviewed Lepista and reclassified it as a subgenus of Clitocybe Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja has called for the sinking of Lepista into Clitocybe, with C. nebularis as the type species of the latter genus. Hence the wood blewit is classified as either Lepista nuda or Clitocybe nuda.\nA 2015 genetic study found that the genera Collybia and Lepista were closely related to the core clade of Clitocybe, but that all three were polyphyletic, with many members in lineages removed from other members of the same genus and instead more closely related to the other two. To complicate matters, the wood blewit is not closely related to the type species of Lepista, L. densifolia. Alvarado and colleagues declined to define the genera but proposed several options and highlighted the need for a wider analysis.\n\nThis species was reassigned to the genus Collybia in 2023.",
    "Names": "The species is commonly known as the wood blewit. Cooke called it the amethyst lepista, John Sibthorp called it the blue-gilled agaric in his 1794 work Flora Oxoniensis.",
    "Description": "This mushroom can range from lilac to purple-pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. Younger specimens are lighter with more convex caps, while mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap, ranging from 4–15 cm (1+1⁄2–6 in) in diameter. The gills are attached to the short, stout stem, which is about 2–6 cm (3⁄4–2+3⁄8 in) long and 1–2.5 cm wide, sometimes larger at the base. Wood blewits have a very distinctive odor, which has been likened by one author to that of frozen orange juice.\nWood blewits can be easily distinguished by their odor, as well as by their spore print, which is white to pale pink.",
    "Similar species": "Wood blewits can be confused with certain blue or purple species of the genus Cortinarius, including the uncommon C. camphoratus, many of which may be poisonous. Cortinarius mushrooms often have the remains of a veil under their caps and a ring-like impression on their stem. Cortinarius species produce a rusty brown spore print after several hours on white paper. Their brown spores often dust their stems and objects beneath them.\nThe species also resembles Collybia brunneocephala, Clitocybe tarda, Laccaria amethysteo-occidentalis, and Lepista subconnexa. It could be confused for members of the rare Texas genus Asproinocybe.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The wood blewit is found in Europe and North America and is becoming more common in Australia and New Zealand, where it appears to have been introduced. In Australia it has developed a relationship with some eucalyptus species and gorse; with an entirely different growth pattern and differs slightly in appearance to its European Lepista nuda cousins. \nIt is a saprotrophic species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December.\nSoil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit fairy ring under Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.\nThe form glaucocana is found in mountainous environs.",
    "Ecology": "In Australia, male satin bowerbirds collect blue objects to decorate their bowers with. A young male was reported to have collected wood blewits to this end near Braidwood in southern New South Wales.",
    "Edibility": "Wood blewits are good edible mushrooms.\nBlewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or sautéed in butter. They can also be cooked like tripe or as omelette filling, and also make good stewing mushrooms. They have a strong flavour, so they combine well with leeks or onions.\nWood blewits can be dried, or can be preserved in olive oil or white vinegar after blanching.\nThe wood blewit has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France. Cultivated wood blewits are said not to taste as good as wild wood blewits."

  "Leratiomyces ceres": {
    "Introduction": "Leratiomyces ceres, commonly known as the chip cherry or redlead roundhead, is a mushroom which has a bright red to orange cap and dark purple-brown spore deposit. The name Stropharia aurantiaca has been used extensively but incorrectly for this mushroom (together with a number of similar synonyms).\nIt is usually found growing gregariously on wood chips and is one of the most common and most distinctive mushrooms found in that habitat. It is common on wood chips and lawns in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.",
    "Taxonomy": "There has been some confusion between L. ceres, which has a fairly thick white stem, and L. squamosus var. thaustus, which has a slender stem and prominent scales below the ring zone (although the two taxa are quite easy to distinguish by sight).  Around 1885 Mordecai Cubitt Cooke originated the names Agaricus squamosus f. aurantiacus and Agaricus thraustus var. aurantiacus, and this later gave rise to the name Stropharia aurantiaca.  This name is defined by Cooke's illustration to his Handbook of British Fungi and in 2004 Richard Fortey discovered that this illustration was not of L. ceres, as had generally been assumed, but it was L. squamosus var. thaustus.  Thus the name aurantiaca is best avoided, being wrong when applied to L. ceres.\n\nThe name Agaricus ceres was created in 1888 by Cooke and Massee for the white-stemmed species, and was reclassified as Psilocybe ceres (in 1891) and Leratiomyces ceres (in 2008).",
    "Description": "L. ceres may be described as follows.\n\nCap: 2 to 6 cm in diameter, with thin flesh and a bright red to orange top which is convex to plane in age. Has white partial veil remnants when young. The cap surface is usually dry, but can be slightly viscid when moist.\nGills: White to pale grey at first, later darker purple/brown or purplish grey with whitish edges. Attached (adnexed to adnate) and often notched.\nStipe: Whitish, often with dark orange stains in age (most evident around base), 3–6 cm long and 0.5 to 1 cm wide, equal to slightly larger at the base, which often has mycelium attached. The veil is thin and leaves a fragile, indistinct ring, sometimes missing with age.  The stalk is smooth above the ring zone and is fluffy with tiny scales below, which often wash off in rain.\nSpores: Dark purple/brown. 10–13.5 × 6–8.5 m. Elliptical and smooth.\nOther microscopic features: Chrysocystidia are present both on the edges and on the faces of the gills.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include L. squamosus, Agrocybe putaminum, Gymnopilus sapineus, Psathyrella corrugis, Stropharia squamosa, S. thrausta, and Tubaria furfuracea.\nIn psilocybin mushroom hunting communities in Australia and New Zealand, L. ceres (or \"Larrys\" as commonly nicknamed) are scorned as lookalikes and imposters of Psilocybe species on wood chip. Prolific growth in the same habitats and a similar appearance from afar can give false hope of a large bounty, but on closer inspection the species are not particularly alike.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "It is usually found growing gregariously on wood chips and is one of the most common and most distinctive mushrooms found in that habitat. It is common on wood chips and lawns in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere."

    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1869.",
    "Description": "The cap is oval in shape when immature, becoming convex to flat when fully grown, reaching up to 3–15 centimetres (1+1⁄4–6 in) wide. The cap feels dry and smooth at the beginning, but gradually gets reddish to reddish brown scales. It is white in color but reddens with maturity or after being handled. The gills are free from the stipe and lie close together. They appear white when young and are stained pinkish to maroon. The stipe is 7–14 cm long, often enlarged at or below the middle and tapering toward the base. It appears white at first, staining or aging pink or reddish brown. It feels smooth with its silky hairs. The membranous veil leaves a white double edged ring on the upper stipe that may disappear in age.\nThe spores are white to cream in color and measure 8–10 x 6–7.5 μm. The flesh is white throughout. It bruises yellow to orange when young but dries reddish when mature. The flesh is thick and discolors when cut, bruised or damaged.\nIt is reported to be edible, but not recommended for consumption because of possible confusion with toxic species like Chlorophyllum molybdites.",

  "Lobaria pulmonaria": {
    "Introduction": "Lobaria pulmonaria is a large epiphytic lichen consisting of an ascomycete fungus and a green algal partner living together in a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium—a symbiosis involving members of three kingdoms of organisms. Commonly known by various names like tree lungwort, lung lichen, lung moss, lungwort lichen, oak lungs or oak lungwort, it is sensitive to air pollution and is also harmed by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices. Its population has declined across Europe and L. pulmonaria is considered endangered in many lowland areas. The species has a history of use in herbal medicines, and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts.",
    "Description": "It is a foliose lichen and its leaf-like thallus is green, leathery and lobed with a pattern of ridges and depressions on the upper surface. Bright green under moist conditions, it becomes brownish and papery when dry. This species often has a fine layers of hairs, a tomentum, on its lower surface. The cortex, the outer protective layer on the thallus surface, is roughly comparable to the epidermis of a green plant. The thallus is typically 5–15 centimetres (2.0–5.9 in) in diameter, with individual lobes 1–3 centimetres (0.39–1.18 in) wide and up to 7 cm long. The asexual reproductive structures soredia and isidia are present on the thallus surface. Minute (0.5–1.5 mm in diameter) cephalodia—pockets of cyanobacteria—are often present on the lower surface of the thallus; these spots are conspicuously darker than the green surface of the thallus. Like other foliose lichens, the thallus is only loosely attached to the surface on which it grows.",
    "Photobionts": "The thallus contains internal structures known as cephalodia, characteristic of three-membered lichen symbioses involving two photobionts (the photosynthetic symbionts in the lichen relationship). These internal cephalodia, found between the \"ribs\" of the thallus surface, arise when blue-green algae (from the genus Nostoc) on the thallus surface are enveloped during mycobiont growth. Structurally, cephalodia consist of dense aggregates of Nostoc cells surrounded by thin-walled hyphae—this delimits them from the rest of the thallus which contains a loose structure of thick-walled hyphae. Blue-green cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen, providing a nutrient for the lichen. The other photobiont of L. pulmonaria is the green alga Dictyochloropsis reticulata.",
    "Reproduction": "Lobaria pulmonaria has the ability to form both vegetative propagation and sexual propagules at an age of about 25 years.  In sexual reproduction, the species produces small reddish-brown discs known as apothecia containing asci, from which spores are forcibly released into the air (like ballistospores). Based on studies of ascospore germination, it has been suggested that L. pulmonaria spores use some mechanism to inhibit germination—the inhibition is lifted when the spores are grown in a synthetic growth medium containing an adsorbent like bovine serum albumin or α-cyclodextrin.\nDispersal by vegetative propagules (via soredia or isidia) has been determined as the predominant mode of reproduction in L. pulmonaria. In this method, the protruding propagules become dry and brittle during the regular wet/dry cycles of the lichen, and can easily crumble off the thallus. These fragments may develop into new thalli, either at the same locale or at a new site after dispersal by wind or rain. A number of steps are required for the development of the vegetative propagules, including the degeneration of the thallus cortex, replication of green algal cells, and entanglement of fungal hyphae with the green algal cells.  These steps lead to an increase in internal pressure which eventually breaks through the cortex. Continued growth leads to these granules being pushed upwards and out of the thallus surface.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It has a wide distribution in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa, preferring damp habitats with high rainfall, especially coastal areas. It is the most widely distributed and most common Lobaria species in North America. In Wales, the Dolmelynllyn estate is notable for the variety of rare bryophytes and lichens there, including the genus Lobaria, in particular Lobaria pulmonaria. Associated with old-growth forests, its presence and abundance may be used as an indicator of forest age, at least in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone in eastern British Columbia. It is also found in pasture-woodlands. It usually grows on the bark of broad-leaved trees such as oak, beech and maple but will also grow on rocks. In the laboratory, L. pulmonaria has been grown on nylon microfilaments.\nVarious environmental factors are thought to affect the distribution of L. pulmonaria, such as temperature, moisture (average humidity, rapidity and frequency of wet-dry cycles), sunlight exposure, and levels of air pollution. Attempts to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of these factors to lichen growth is difficult because differences in the original environment from which the lichen thalli are collected will greatly affect heat and desiccation tolerances.\nDue to declining population, L. pulmonaria is considered to be rare or threatened in many parts of the world, especially in lowland areas of Europe. The decline has been attributed to industrial forestry and air pollution, particularly acid rain. L. pulmonaria, like other lichens containing a blue-green algal component, are particularly susceptible to the effects of acid rain, because the subsequent decrease in pH reduces nitrogen fixation through inhibition of the algal nitrogenase enzyme.",
    "Chemical compounds": "Lobaria pulmonaria is known to contain a variety of acids common to lichens, such as stictic acid, desmethyl stictic acid, gyrophoric acid, tenuiorin, constictic acid, norstictic acid, peristictic acid, and methylnorstictic acid.  These compounds, collectively known as depsidones, are known to be involved in defense against grazing herbivores like lichen-feeding molluscs. It also contains the sugar alcohols D-arabitol, volemitol, in addition to several carotenoids (total content > 10 mg/kg), such as alpha carotene, beta carotene, and beta cryptoxanthin. The upper cortex of the lichen contains melanins that screen UV and PAR radiation from the photobiont. The synthesis of melanin pigments in the lichen increases in response to greater solar irradiation, and shade-adapted thalli are greenish-grey in the air-dry state, while sun-exposed thalli can be dark brown in color. This adaptation helps protect the photosymbiont D. reticulata, known to be relatively intolerant to high light levels.\nAlso known to be present are various steroids, namely ergosterol, episterol, fecosterol, and lichesterol.",
    "Medicinal": "Its shape somewhat resembles the tissue inside lungs and therefore it is thought to be a remedy for lung diseases based on the doctrine of signatures. The lichen's common English names are derived from this association. Gerard's book The Herball or General Historie of plants (1597) recommends L. pulmonaria as medicinally valuable. It is still used for asthma, urinary incontinence and lack of appetite.  In India it is used as a traditional medicine to treat hemorrhages and eczema, and it is used as a remedy for coughing up blood by the Hesquiaht in British Columbia, Canada. An ethnophytotherapeutical survey of the high Molise region in central-southern Italy revealed that L. pulmonaria is used as an antiseptic, and is rubbed on wounds.\nA hot-water extract prepared using this species has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and ulcer-preventing activities. Also, methanol extracts were shown to have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal system of rats, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and reducing the inflammatory effects of neutrophils. Furthermore, methanol extracts also have potent antioxidative activity and reducing power, probably due to the presence of phenolic compounds.",
    "Other uses": "Lobaria pulmonaria has also been used to produce an orange dye for wool, in the tanning of leather, in the manufacture of perfumes and as an ingredient in brewing."

  "Lycogala epidendrum": {
    "Introduction": "Lycogala epidendrum, commonly known as wolf's milk or groening's slime, is a cosmopolitan species of myxogastrid amoeba which is often mistaken for a fungus. The aethalia, or fruiting bodies, occur either scattered or in groups on damp rotten wood, especially on large logs, from June to November. These aethalia are small, pink to brown cushion-like blobs. They may ooze a pink \"paste\" if the outer wall is broken before maturity. When mature, the colour tends to become more brownish. When not fruiting, single celled individuals move about as very small, red amoeba-like organisms called plasmodia, masses of protoplasm that engulf bacteria, as well as fungal and plant spores, protozoa, and particles of non-living organic matter through phagocytosis (see slime mould for more information).",
    "Description": "During the plasmodial stage, individuals are reddish in colour, but these are almost never seen. When conditions change, the individuals aggregate by means of chemical signalling to form an aethalium, or fruiting body. These appear as small cushion-like blobs measuring about 3–15 millimetres (0.12–0.59 in) in diameter. Colour is quite variable, ranging from pinkish grey to yellowish brown or greenish black, with mature individuals tending towards the darker end. They may be either round or somewhat compressed with a warted or rough texture. While immature they are filled with a pink, paste-like fluid. With maturity the fluid becomes a powdery mass of minute grey spores. The spores measure 6 to 7.5 μm and are round in shape with a netted texture and appearing ochre to lavender in colour. The pseudocapillitia, sterile elements in the spore mass, are long, flattened, branching tubes with transverse wrinkles and folds.",

  "Lycoperdon perlatum": {
    "Introduction": "Lycoperdon perlatum, popularly known as the common puffball, warted puffball, gem-studded puffball or devil's snuff-box, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. It is a medium-sized puffball with a round fruit body tapering to a wide stalk, and dimensions of 1.5 to 6 cm (1⁄2 to 2+1⁄4 in) wide by 3 to 10 cm (1+1⁄4 to 4 in) tall. It is off-white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or \"jewels\", which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface. When mature it becomes brown and a hole in the top opens to release spores in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops.\n\nA widespread species with a cosmopolitan distribution, the species grows in fields, gardens, and grassy clearings. It is edible when young and the internal flesh is completely white, although care must be taken to avoid confusion with immature fruit bodies of poisonous Amanita species. L. perlatum can usually be distinguished from similar puffballs by differences in surface texture. Several chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of L. perlatum, including sterol derivatives, volatile compounds that give the puffball its flavor and odor, and the unusual amino acid lycoperdic acid. Extracts of the puffball have antimicrobial and antifungal activities.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. Synonyms include Lycoperdon gemmatum (as described by August Batsch in 1783), the variety L. gemmatum var. perlatum (published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1829), L. bonordenii (George Edward Massee, 1887), and L. perlatum var. bonordenii (A. C. Perdeck, 1950).\nL. perlatum is the type species of the genus Lycoperdon. Molecular analyses suggest a close phylogenetic relationship with L. marginatum.\nThe specific epithet perlatum is Latin for \"widespread\". It is commonly known as the common puffball, the gem-studded puffball (or gemmed puffball), the warted puffball, or the devil's snuff-box; Samuel Frederick Gray called it the pearly puff-ball in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants. Because some indigenous peoples believed that the spores caused blindness, the puffball has some local names such as \"blindman's bellows\" and \"no-eyes\".",
    "Description": "The fruit body ranges in shape from pear-like with a flattened top, to nearly spherical, and reaches dimensions of 1.5 to 6 cm (1⁄2 to 2+1⁄4 in) wide by 3 to 9 cm (1+1⁄4 to 3+1⁄2 in) tall. It has a stem-like base, and is whitish before browning in age. The outer surface of the fruit body (the exoperidium) is covered in short cone-shaped spines that are interspersed with granular warts. The spines, which are whitish, gray, or brown, can be easily rubbed off, and leave reticulate pock marks or scars after they are removed. The base of the puffball is thick. It is initially white, but turns yellow, olive, or brownish in age. The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed-off spines is less evident on the base.\nIn maturity, the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away, revealing a pre-formed hole (ostiole) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the gleba, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature.  The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in L. pyriforme using high-speed schlieren photography determined that raindrops of 1 mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100 cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores.\n\nThe spores are spherical, thick-walled, covered with minute spines, and measure 3.5–4.5 μm in diameter. The capillitia (threadlike filaments in the gleba in which spores are embedded) are yellow-brown to brownish in color, lack septae, and measure 3–7.5 μm in diameter. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 7–9 by 4–5 μm. The basidia bear four slender sterigmata of unequal length ranging from 5–10 μm long. The surface spines are made of chains of pseudoparenchymatous hyphae (resembling the parenchyma  of higher plants), in which the individual hyphal cells are spherical to elliptical in shape, thick-walled (up to 1 μm), and measure 13–40 by 9–35 μm. These hyphae do not have clamp connections.",
    "Similar species": "There are several other puffball species with which L. perlatum might be confused. L. nettyanum, found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, is covered in granular patches, but these granules adhere more strongly to the surface than those of L. perlatum. L. pyriforme lacks prominent spines on the surface, and grows on rotting wood—although if growing on buried wood, it may appear to be terrestrial. The widely distributed and common L. umbrinum has spines that do not leave scars when rubbed off, a gleba that varies in color from dark brown to purple-brown at maturity, and a purple-tinged base. The small and rare species L. muscorum grows in deep moss. L. peckii can be distinguished from L. pyriforme by the lavender-tinged spines it has when young. L. rimulatum has purplish spores, and an almost completely smooth exoperidium. L. excipuliforme is larger and grayer, and, in mature individuals, the upper portion of its fruit body breaks down completely to release its spores.  In the field, L. marginatum is distinguished from L. perlatum by the way in which the spines are shed from the exoperidium in irregular sheets.",
    "Ecology and distribution": "A saprobic species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in fairy rings. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It has been reported from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance.\nA widespread species with an almost cosmopolitan distribution, it has been reported from Africa (Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India Iran), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from subarctic areas of Greenland, and subalpine regions in Iceland. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from Alaska to Mexico, although it is less common in Central America.\nThe puffball bioaccumulates heavy metals present in the soil, and can be used as a bioindicator of soil pollution by heavy metals and selenium. In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead. L. perlatum biomass has been shown experimentally to remove mercury ions from aqueous solutions, and is being investigated for potential use as a low-cost, renewable, biosorptive material in the treatment of water and wastewater containing mercury.",
    "Edibility": "Lycoperdon perlatum is considered a good edible mushroom when young, when the gleba is still homogeneous and white. They have been referred to as \"poor man's sweetbread\" due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs, or used in soups as a substitute for dumplings. As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil. The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. L. perlatum is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The fruit bodies are appealing to animals as well: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) includes the puffball in their diet of non-truffle fungi, while the \"puffball beetle\" Caenocara subglobosum uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding. Nutritional analysis indicates that the puffballs are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and several micronutrients. The predominant fatty acids in the puffball are linoleic acid (37% of the total fatty acids), oleic acid (24%), palmitic acid (14.5%), and stearic acid (6.4%).\nThe immature 'buttons' or 'eggs' of deadly Amanita species can be confused with puffballs. This can be avoided by slicing fruit bodies vertically and inspecting them for the internal developing structures of a mushroom, which would indicate the poisonous Amanita. Additionally, amanitas will generally not have \"jewels\" or a bumpy external surface.\nThe spores' surfaces have many microscopic spines and can cause severe irritation of the lung (lycoperdonosis) when inhaled. This condition has been reported to afflict dogs that play or run where the puffballs are present.",
    "Chemistry": "Several steroid derivatives have been isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L. perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant components of the volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against laboratory cultures of the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with activity comparable to that of the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L. perlatum puffballs to contain cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14 milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.\nThe amino acid lycoperdic acid (chemical name 3-(5(S)-carboxy-2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5(S)-yl)-2(S)-alanine) was isolated from the puffball, and reported in a 1978 publication. Based on the structural similarity of the new amino acid with (S)-glutamic acid, (S)-(+)-lycoperdic acid is expected to have antagonistic or agonistic activity for the glutamate receptor in the mammalian central nervous system. Methods to synthesize the compounds were reported in 1992, 1995, and 2002.",

  "Lycoperdon pyriforme": {
    "Introduction": "Apioperdon pyriforme, commonly known as the pear-shaped puffball or stump puffball, is a species of fungus. It is often called Lycoperdon pyriforme, but was transferred to Apioperdon in 2017. It is the only species in the genus.\nIt is a saprobic fungus present throughout much of the world, growing on decaying wood. It is considered a choice edible when still immature and the inner flesh is white.",
    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was first described in the scientific literature by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774. In 2001, DNA evidence compiled by Dirk Krüger and a number of other mycologists suggested that the genus Lycoperdon was polyphyletic, with the pear-shaped puffball differing most significantly from the group. This finding was supported by several morphological differences including the presence of rhizomorphs and its preference for wood.\nA 2003 publication of further research moved the puffball to the genus Morganella with the specific epithet's ending changed for agreement. In 2008, however, Larsson and Jeppson revisited the phylogeny of the Lycoperdaceae, with a broader sampling of species, and retained the taxon in Lycoperdon.  It was renamed Apioperdon pyriforme in 2017 based on phylogenetic and morphological differences. It is the only species in the genus.\nThe specific epithet pyriforme is Latin for \"pear-shaped\".",
    "Description": "The fruit body of the pear-shaped puffball measures up to 3 centimetres (1+1⁄4 in) wide and 6 cm (2+1⁄4 in) tall. They are often pear-shaped as the name suggests, but they may also be nearly spherical. When very young they are covered in small white spines that typically fall off before maturity. A small developing pore may be visible at the top, while the sterile base of the mushroom is small and appears to be pinched in. Colour ranges from nearly white to yellowish brown with the darker shades developing with age, though the base remains white. The central pore ruptures at late maturity to allow the wind and rain to disperse the spores. The base is attached to the wood by means of rhizomorphs (thick, cord-like strands of mycelium).\n\nThe gleba, or inner spore mass, is white when young, but it becomes greenish-yellow to dark olive-brown with age. The spores measure 3 to 4.5 μm and are round, smooth and a dark olive-brown in colour.",

    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was first described in 1772 by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, who named it Agaricus procerus. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Macrolepiota in 1948.",
    "Description": "The immature cap is compact and egg-shaped, with the cap margin around the stipe, sealing a chamber inside the cap. As it matures, the margin breaks off, leaving a fleshy, movable ring around the stipe. The cap can reach 25 centimetres (10 in) wide. At full maturity, the cap is more or less flat, with a smooth, dark umbo in the centre. Dark and cap-coloured flakes remain on the upper surface of the cap and can be removed easily.\nThe stipe is relatively thin, growing up to 12–40 cm (4+1⁄2–15+1⁄2 in) long and 1.5 cm thick, reaching its full height before the cap expands. Below the ring, the stem has scaly growths, creating the appearance of snakeskin. The gills are crowded, free, and white or pale pink in age. The spore print is white. The whitish flesh may have a pale pink hue but does not stain when cut. It has a pleasant nutty smell.",
    "Similar species": "Although the parasol mushroom is difficult to mistake for any other, there are a few similar-looking poisonous species.\n\nChlorophyllum molybdites causes the largest number of annual mushroom poisonings in North America due to its close similarity. Faintly green gills and a pale green spore deposit give it away, with the stipe lacking a snakeskin pattern. Its range is reportedly expanding into Europe.\nLeucocoprinus brunnea, also found in North America, slowly turns brown when sliced.\nWhite and immature species of Amanita are also a potential hazard. To be sure, one must only pick parasol mushrooms past their button stage. Generally, the parasol mushroom has darker flakes on a lighter surface, whereas Amanitas have the opposite, lighter flakes (if any) on a darker surface, such as A. pantherina (panther cap); this rule does not apply to all species, such as A. smithiana.\nCystoderma amianthinum (saffron parasol) is much smaller and not often eaten.\nLepiota brunneoincarnata is much smaller than M. procera and known to have caused fatal poisonings in Spain.\nAdditionally, members of Chlorophyllum section Rhacodium lack the snakeskin pattern, such as the smaller C. rhacodes (shaggy parasol), which has an overlapping range. Macrolepiota mastoidea is a rare European edible mushroom, generally smaller than M. procera and well less obvious stipe markings. Agaricus species have brown spores and the gills of mature specimens are never white.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Macrolepiota procera is a fairly common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and fairy rings in pastures and occasionally in woodland. It is widespread in temperate regions of Eurasia and possibly North America. Further research is needed to confirm whether specimens found in North America are the same species.",
    "Uses": "The species is choice as an edible mushroom. It is sought after and popular in Europe, due in part to its large size, seasonal frequency, and versatility in the kitchen. In the United Kingdom, it can be found from July through to November. The stipe is inedible due to being very fibrous in texture, unless dried and ground into a powder.\nThese mushrooms are popularly sauteed in melted butter. In central and eastern European countries this mushroom is usually prepared similarly to a cutlet. It is usually run through egg and breadcrumbs and then fried in a pan with some oil or butter. A savory Slovak recipe is to bake caps stuffed with ground pork, oregano, and garlic. Italians and Austrians also serve the young, still-spherical caps stuffed with seasoned minced beef, baked in the same manner as stuffed peppers.",
    "Other common names": "In some parts of Europe, it is known as the \"snake's hat\" or \"snake's sponge\" due to its scales."

  "Merulius tremellosus": {
    "Introduction": "Phlebia tremellosa (formerly Merulius tremellosus), commonly known as trembling Merulius or jelly rot, is a species of fungus in the family Meruliaceae. It is a common and widely distributed wood-decay fungus that grows on the rotting wood of both hardwood and conifer plants.",
    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was originally described in 1794 by German botanist Heinrich Adolf Schrader, who called it Merulius tremellosus. Nakasone and Burdsall transferred the taxon to the genus Phlebia in 1984, when they placed Merulius in synonymy.\nIt is commonly known as the \"trembling Merulius\", or \"jelly rot\".",
    "Description": "Fruit bodies of the fungus are fan-shaped to semicircular, measuring 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+5⁄8 in) wide by 5–10 cm (2–3+7⁄8 in) long. They have a spongy to fibrous texture, comprising stalkless caps or spreading crusts. The upper surface, white to pale yellow in colour, can be dry to moist, and hairy to woolly; the margin is usually white to translucent. The undersurface, bearing the fertile hymenium, features radiating to wrinkled ridges and cross veins, and often forms pore-like depressions on mature specimens. Its colour is yellowish orange or pinkish orange. The flesh of this fungus is about 2 mm thick, with a fleshy to gelatinous texture and white to yellowish colour.\nThe visual similarity of the fungus to bacon gives rise to the Dutch common name bacon-pork rind mushroom, although it is inedible.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Phlebia tremellosa is found in Asia, Europe, North Africa, North America, and South America. It is a white rot species that grows on the stumps, fallen branches, and logs of both hardwoods and conifers."

    "Introduction": "Mutinus ravenelii, or Ravenel's red stinkhorn, is a species of fungus that is often confused with M. elegans and M. caninus. M. ravenelii is a member of the Phallaceae (stinkhorn) family.",
    "Edibility": "The 'eggs' of Mutinus ravenelii are edible while the adult fungus itself is not yet known to be edible."
  },
  "Mycena haematopus": {
    "Introduction": "Mycena haematopus, commonly known as the bleeding fairy helmet, the burgundydrop bonnet, or the bleeding Mycena, is a species of fungus in the family Mycenaceae, of the order Agaricales. First described scientifically in 1799, it is classified in the section Lactipedes of the genus Mycena, along with other species that produce a milky or colored latex.\nThe fruit bodies of M. haematopus have caps that are up to 4 cm (1+5⁄8 in) wide, whitish gills, and a thin, fragile reddish-brown stem with thick coarse hairs at the base. They are characterized by their reddish color, the scalloped cap edges, and the dark red latex they \"bleed\" when cut or broken. Both the fruit bodies and the mycelia are weakly bioluminescent.\nIt is widespread and common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in old Japan and Venezuela. It is saprotrophic—meaning that it obtains nutrients by consuming decomposing organic matter—and the fruit bodies appear in small groups or clusters on the decaying logs, trunks, and stumps of deciduous trees, particularly beech. The edibility of the species is not known definitively. It produces various unique alkaloid pigments.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was initially named Agaricus haematopus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1799, and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum. In the classification of Fries, only a few genera were named, and most agaric mushrooms were grouped in Agaricus, which was organized into a large number of tribes. Mycena haematopus gained its current name in 1871 when the German fungal taxonomist Paul Kummer raised many of Fries' Agaricus tribes to the level of genus, including Mycena. In 1909 Franklin Sumner Earle placed the species in Galactopus, a genus that is no longer considered separate from Mycena. Mycena haematopus is placed in the section Lactipedes, a grouping of Mycenas characterized by the presence of a milky or colored latex in the stem and flesh of the cap. The specific epithet is derived from Ancient Greek roots meaning \"blood\" (αἱματο-, haimato-) and \"foot\" (πους, pous), owing to the red latex than can easily be produced by breaking the mushroom at the base. It is commonly known as the blood-foot mushroom, the bleeding fairy helmet, the burgundydrop bonnet, or the bleeding Mycena.\nIn 1914, Jakob Emanuel Lange described the variety M. haematopus var. marginata, characterized by the reddish color on the edge of the gills; Mycena specialist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus considered the coloration of the gill edge too variable to have taxonomical significance. Mycena haematopus var. cuspidata was initially found in Colorado in 1976, and described as a new variety by American mycologists Duane Mitchel and Alexander H. Smith two years later. The fruit bodies are characterized by a \"beak\" on the cap that often splits or collapses as the cap matures. It was treated as Mycena sanguinolenta var. cuspidata by Maas Geesteranus in 1988.",
    "Description": "The fruit bodies of Mycena haematopus are the reproductive structures produced by cellular threads or hyphae which grow in rotting wood. The shape of the cap of the fruit body will vary depending on its maturity. Young caps, or \"buttons\", are ovoid (egg-shaped) to conical; later they are campanulate (bell-shaped), and as the fruit body matures, the margins (cap edge) lift upward so that the cap becomes somewhat flat with an umbo (a central nipple-shaped bump). The fully grown cap can reach up to 4 cm (1+5⁄8 in) in diameter. The surface of the cap initially appears dry and covered with what appears to be a very fine whitish powder, but it soon becomes polished and moist. Mature caps appear somewhat translucent, and develop radial grooves mirroring the position of the gills underneath. The color of the cap is reddish- or pinkish-brown, often tinged with violet, and paler towards the edge. The margin is wavy like the edge of a scallop and may appear ragged because of lingering remnants of the partial veil.\nThe gills have an adnate attachment to the stem, meaning they are more or less directly attached to it. They are initially whitish or \"grayish vinaceous\" in color, and can develop reddish-brown stains. Between 20 and 30 gills reach from the cap edge to the stem, resulting in a gill spacing that is described as \"close to subdistant\"—gaps are visible between adjacent gills. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend directly from the margin to the stem; these are arranged in two or three series (tiers) of equal length. The stem is 3–9 cm (1+1⁄8–3+1⁄2 in) tall and 0.1–0.2 cm (1⁄32–3⁄32 in) thick, hollow and brittle, and a dark reddish-brown color. In young fruit bodies, the upper part of the stem is densely covered with a pale cinnamon-colored powder which wears off with age. The stem has a mass of coarse hairs at the base.\n\nThe mushroom flesh can range from pale to the color of red wine (vinaceous), and has no distinctive odor. It oozes a red latex when cut or otherwise injured. The flavour is mild to slightly bitter.",
    "Bioluminescence": "Both the mycelium and the fruit bodies of M. haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are reported to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20 hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M. haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "The spore print is white. The spores are elliptical, smooth, with dimensions of 8–11 by 5–7 μm. They are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells (basidia) are 4-spored. Sterile cells called cystidia are numerous on the edges on the gills; they measure 33–60 μm (sometimes up to 80) by 9–12 μm. Cystidia that are present on the stipe (caulocystidia) appear in clusters, and clublike to irregular in shape, measuring 20–55 by 3.5–12.5 μm. The gill tissue contains numerous lactifers, cells that produce the latex that is secreted when it is cut.\nThe surface mycelium is whitish and fluffy. Swelling at the terminal tips of hyphae (diameter up to 12 μm) is present, but not very abundant, and moniliform hyphae are very rare. Extracellular oxidase enzymes are present, consistent with its ecological role as a saprobe.",
    "Similar species": "Another Mycena that produces a reddish latex is M.  sanguinolenta (the terrestrial bleeding Mycena). It may be distinguished from M. haematopus in several ways: it is smaller, with cap diameters between 0.3 to 1 cm (1⁄8 to 3⁄8 in) wide; grows in groups rather than clusters; is found on leaves, dead branches, moss beds and pine needle beds rather than decaying wood; and the edges of its gills are consistently dark brownish-red. Furthermore, the cap color of M. sanguinolenta ranges from reddish-to orange-brown and it lacks a band of partial veil remnants hanging from the margin.\nOther similar species include M.  californiensis and M.  purpureofusca.",
    "Distribution, habitat and ecology": "In North America, M. haematopus is distributed from Alaska southward. According to Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith, it is \"the commonest and the most easily recognized one in the genus\". The species is common in Europe and has also been collected from Japan, and Mérida, Venezuela (as the variety M. haematopus var. marginata). In the Netherlands, M. haematopus is one of many mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber wharves. The fruit bodies can be found year-round in mild weather.\nThe mushroom obtains nutrients from decomposing organic matter (saprobic) and the fruit bodies can typically be found growing on stumps and well-decayed logs, usually in groups that are joined together by a common base. The decomposition of woody debris on the forest floor is the result of the combined activity of a community of fungal species. In the sequential succession of mushrooms species, M. haematopus is a \"late colonizer\" fungus: its fruit bodies appear after the wood has first been decayed by white rot species. The initial stage of wood decay by white rot fungi involves the breakdown of \"acid-unhydrolyzable residue\" and holocellulose (a mixture of cellulose and hemicellulose).\nMycena haematopus can be parasitized by Spinellus fusiger, another fungal species which gives the mushroom a strikingly hairy appearance.",
    "Edibility": "Although some sources claim that M. haematopus is edible, it is disregarded due to being insubstantial. Other sources consider the species inedible, or recommend avoiding consumption due to the potential toxicity of related taxa.",
    "Natural products": "The species produces several unique chemicals. The primary pigment is haematopodin B, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of pyrrole and quinoline, both heterocyclic aromaticorganic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities. Additional alkaloid compounds in M. haematopus include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior to the discovery of these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.",

  "Mycena leaiana": {
    "Introduction": "Mycena leaiana, commonly known as the orange mycena or Lea's mycena, is a species of saprobic fungi in the genus Mycena, family Mycenaceae. They have bright orange caps and stalks and reddish-orange gill edges. Typically found in North America, a variety, M. leaiana var. australis, can be found in Australasia.\nThe mushrooms usually grow in dense clusters on deciduous logs. The pigment responsible for the orange color in this species has antibiotic properties.",
    "Taxonomy": "Originally named Agaricus leajanus by the English biologist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1845, Pier Andrea Saccardo was later (1891) to move it to the genus Mycena when the large genus Agaricus was divided. The species was named after Thomas Gibson Lea (1785–1844), a mushroom collector from Ohio who had sent a collection of specimens to Berkeley for identification.",
    "Description": "The hygrophanous cap is 1 to 4 centimetres (0.39 to 1.57 in) in diameter, and initially rounded or bell-shaped but becoming expanded and convex with age, often with a depression in the center. The color is a bright orange that fades as the mushroom matures. The surface of the cap is sticky, especially in moist weather, and smooth, while the margin often has striations. The trama is soft, watery, and white. The gills are adnexed in attachment (gills narrowly attached/tapering toward stem so that their attachment is almost free), crowded together, and yellowish in color, with the color deepening to bright orange-red at the edges. The deepening in color at the edges is due to an orange pigment that is contained largely within cells called cheilocystidia. If handled, the yellow pigment will rub off and stain the skin.\nThe stipe is typically 3 to 7 cm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long by 2–4 mm thick. The diameter of the stipe is more or less equal throughout its length, although it may be slightly enlarged at the base. It is orange in color, and has fine hairs on the upper portion, and denser hairs at the base. The orange mycena has no distinctive taste, and a slightly mealy odor. The spores are elliptical in shape, smooth, amyloid, and have dimensions of 7–10 × 5–6  μm. The spore print is white.\nMycena leaiana var. australis is a variety of Mycena leaiana found in Australia and New Zealand. In all but the color it is similar to M. leaiana. However, M. leaiana had been found primarily in the east of the United States (and specifically not on the Pacific coast at all) upon the discovery of specimens in Australia. Given this wide geographical separation (as well as the difference in cap color) a new varietal name was proposed.",
    "Similar species": "Mycena texensis A.H. Sm. (1937) is closely related, but has been described as having \"grayish colors of the cap\". It is better distinguished microscopically: it has smaller spores, shorter and narrower basidia, and distinctive cystidia.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Mycena leaiana is a common species, and grows in dense cespitose clusters (with stipes sharing a single point of origin) on hardwood logs and branches. It is a North American species, and has been reported throughout the eastern and central U.S. and Canada. The variant Mycena leaiana var. australis can be found in Australia and New Zealand.",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Mycena leaiana produces the orange pigment leainafulvene, a member of the class of chemical compounds known as isoilludanes. Leainafulvene has weak antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and has pronounced cytotoxic activity towards tumor cells.  It also has mutagenic activity, as measured by the Ames test.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Nectria cinnabarina": {
    "Introduction": "Nectria cinnabarina, also known as coral spot, is a plant pathogen that causes cankers on broadleaf trees.  This disease is polycyclic and infects trees in the cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  N. cinnabarina is typically saprophytic, but will act as a weak parasite if presented with an opportunity via wounds in the tree or other stressors that weaken the tree's defense to the disease.  A study published in 2011 showed that this complex consists of at least 4 distinct species.  There are only a few ways to manage this disease with techniques such as sanitation and pruning away branches that have the cankers.  N. cinnabarina is not as significant a problem as other Nectria spp., some of which are the most important pathogens to infect hardwood trees.",
    "Hosts and symptoms": "Nectria cinnabarina, also known as coral spot, is a weak pathogen of broadleaf trees. While beech is the main host, the parasite can also affect Sycamore, Horse Chestnut, and Hornbeam. This pathogen usually affects trees that have already been weakened as a result of stressful factors, such as drought or fungal infestation. Physical damage can also make the tree susceptible to the pathogen. The pathogen forms pink fungal blobs (indicative of its sexual stage) on the outside of dead wood which turn a reddish-brown color and become quite hard. The blobs are usually 1 to 4 mm in length. Other symptoms include small twigs and branches dying back and branch necrosis. The bark that is infected becomes weak and tends to snap off in windy weather. The pathogen thrives in dead wood and airborne spores infect living trees and shrubs through wounds. Since it is caused by a weak fungus, isolation of the pathogen from diseased tissue and an analysis for fungal properties, such as induced sporulation or microscopically seeing cross-walls in hyphae, can aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, many fungi studies in media involve the formation of concentric hyphal zonations or rings of sporulation as the colony develops. This zonation is usually attributed to environmental changes. The sporulation rhythm of N. cinnabarina is conveyed by concentric rings or spirals and is dependent on temperature.",
    "Disease cycle": "Typically, N. cinnabarina grows as a saprophyte on dead wood. If a plant is wounded, the pathogen becomes an opportunistic weak parasite and infects susceptible plants. The complex life cycle of the N. cinnabarina would be characterized as polycyclic because it is capable of several infection cycles. During spring or early summer, coral pink or light purplish red spore-producing structures form. These age to tan or brown. This is the sexual stage and is distinguished by the aforementioned pink structures, which are tough perithecia that produce sexual spores. Because N. cinnabarina has sporodochial anamorphs, the perithecia form within the sporodochium. In summer and autumn, orange-red fruiting structures are produced; eventually these structures mature to dark red and can survive through the winter. This is the asexual stage and it is characterized by spongy conidia which can be distinguished by the hard, dark red blobs on the bark. Both of these structures release spores that can be dispersed by water and invade susceptible tissue.",
    "Environment": "Nectria cinnabarina is common in the cool, temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  It is widespread throughout the UK and parts of mainland Europe, typically wherever there are hosts for the pathogen.  The fungus enters the plant by wounds caused by improper pruning, storm damage, and other types of mechanical damage.  Infection typically occurs in these wounds when there is a surplus of water, and the temperature is above freezing.  Infection is most common in the spring and fall.",
    "Management": "There are only a few ways to manage disease caused by N. cinnabarina. One way to control the spread of this fungus is pruning branches of trees that have cankers. N. cinnabarina is a saprophyte and mainly resides in and on dead tissue, but as the fungus progresses, it invades living tissue and causes further disease. Trimming the areas so that no dead tissue remains is important because this removes the areas where the fungus is spreading from dead tissue to living tissue.\nAnother important control measure is to make sure all pruning tools are sanitized. This will prevent the spread of the fungus from infected branches to healthy branches. Pruning should be done during dry periods to prevent the possibility of creating a wound in the tree while the fungus is sporulating. N. cinnabarina is an opportunistic weak parasite that will mainly affect trees that are stressed. Choosing tree species that grow well in the environmental conditions of the area is a good way to keep them from being stressed.\nDrought stress, root pruning, and transplantation of trees are all stressors that may cause susceptibility to infection by this fungus and these processes should generally be avoided if the fungus is suspected to be present. Keeping trees from being stressed is important because the natural defense of trees is to form cankers around infected areas, which contain the fungus and prevent it from spreading. However, stressed trees have a slower canker response, which allows the fungus to proliferate and spread to other areas of the tree and may eventually lead to death of the tree.",
    "Importance": "The pathogen was first described in 1791 when the German mycologist and theologian Heinrich Julius Tode described this fungus under the scientific name, Sphaeria cinnabarina.  This name was changed when Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries transferred the species to the Nectria genus in 1849.  The currently adopted scientific name, Nectria cinnabarina, was then born.  According to the article “The Range and Importance of Nectaria Canker on hardwoods in the NorthEast” by D.S. Welch, one of the most important pathogens to affect hardwood trees is the Nectria genus, or Nectria canker caused by Nectria spp.  The Nectria Canker is a fungal infection of the cortex and cambium that spreads slowly over the years.  N. cinnabarina is not as significant a problem as other Nectria spp., some of which are the most important to infect hardwoods.",
    "Pathogenesis": "Nectria cinnabarina is typically saprophytic but will act as a weak parasite if presented with an opportunity via wounds in the tree or other stressors that weaken the tree's defense to the disease. When a tree is stressed it has a slower response to infection by N. cinnabarina, which allows the fungus to continue spreading throughout the tree and cause further infection. N. cinnabarina typically invades dead tissue first and then spreads to living tissue via hyphae that grow through the xylem. This causes dieback and allows further colonization of the fungus. It is also possible for the spores of the pathogen to infect living tissue through the lenticels, but this typically only occurs in stressed plants.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Omphalotus illudens": {
    "Introduction": "Omphalotus illudens, commonly known as the eastern jack-o'lantern mushroom, is a North American species of fungus.",
    "Description": "It forms a large, orange mushroom. The caps grow up to 15 centimetres (6 in) wide. The gills are decurrent and the stem is up to 15 cm long. The flesh is orange and the spore print is white to cream.\nIts gills often exhibit a weak green bioluminescence when fresh. This green glow has been mentioned in several journal articles, which state that the phenomenon can persist up to 40–50 hours after the mushroom has been picked. It is believed that this display serves to attract insects to the mushroom's gills at night, which can then distribute its spores across a wider area.",
    "Similar species": "Omphalotus lludens is replaced by O. subilludens on the Gulf Coast, and O. olivascens is found in California. Desarmillaria tabescens forms small, dull orange caps.\nOmphalotus illudens is sometimes confused with edible chanterelles, but can be distinguished by its thicker, fleshier appearance, tendency to form large clusters, and clearly separated caps when young. Unlike chanterelles, O. illudens is poisonous to humans when eaten, whether raw or cooked. Although some older literature claims the name is synonymous with O. olearius, phylogenetic analysis confirms the two as distinct species.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Omphalotus illudens is often found in clumps on decaying stumps, buried roots, or at the base of hardwood trees in eastern North America (June–November).",
    "Toxicity": "The poisonous chemical compounds illudin S and illudin M were isolated from O. illudens. In addition to their antibacterial and antifungal effects, illudins appear to be the cause of human toxicity when these mushrooms are eaten raw or cooked, causing vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea. Muscarine has also been indirectly implicated in toxicity, but modern studies to demonstrate its presence in O. illudens are needed.\nThe cytotoxic effect of illudin is of interest for treating some cancers, but illudin itself is too poisonous to use directly so it must first be chemically modified. Inside human cells, illudin S reacts with DNA and creates a type of DNA damage that blocks transcription. This block can only be relieved by a repair system called nucleotide excision repair. Damage in non-transcribed DNA areas is left unrepaired by the cell. This property was exploited by the company MGI Pharma to develop an illudin-derivative called Irofulven for use as a cancer treatment. Its application is still in the experimental phase."

    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was described as new to science in 1976 by American mycologists Howard E. Bigelow, Orson K. Miller Jr., and Harry D. Thiers. A subspecies with blue flesh, O. olivascens var. indigo, was described growing on live oak in Baja California, Mexico.",
    "Description": "The cap is 4–18 cm (1.6–7.1 in) wide. The stalks are 4–15 cm (1.6–5.9 in) long and 1–4 cm (0.39–1.57 in) wide. The spores are white to pale yellow.",
    "Similar species": "To an untrained eye, O. olivascens appears similar to Cantharellus cibarius, but the jack-o'-lantern mushroom has true, blade-like gills (rather than ridges) and it can have olive coloration that chanterelles lack; also, Omphalotus species are saprotrophic, grow directly on wood, and are bioluminescent.\nSeveral Omphalotus species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (O. olearius) and the tsukiyotake (O. japonicus (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as Lampteromyces japonicus (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. Molecular analysis shows the jack-o'-lantern to be most closely related to the ghost fungus O. nidiformis, the colours and shades of which most closely resemble O. olivascens. Additionally, O. illudens is similar.\nGymnopilus junonius is another similar-looking species.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It is endemic to the  North American west coast, namely the California Floristic Province.",
    "Ecology": "A saprobe or parasite, O. olivascens is usually found on oak or Eucalyptus, rarely on other hosts.\nOmphalotus species cause a white rot by breaking down lignin in their tree hosts.",
    "Toxicity": "The jack o'lantern mushroom is poisonous; while not lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to very severe cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nThe toxic ingredient of many species of Omphalotus is a sesquiterpene compound known as illudin S. This, along with illudin M, have been identified in O. nidiformis. The two illudins are common to the genus Omphalotus and not found in any other basidiomycete mushroom."

  "Panellus stipticus": {
    "Introduction": "Panellus stipticus, commonly known as the bitter oyster, the astringent panus, the luminescent panellus, or the stiptic fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Mycenaceae. It is the type species of the genus Panellus. The fungus was given its current scientific name in 1879, but has been known by many names since French mycologist Jean Bulliard first described it as Agaricus stypticus in 1783. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed P. stipticus to have a close genetic relationship with members of the genus Mycena.\nStarting out as tiny white knobs, over a period of one to three months, the mushrooms develop into fan- or kidney-shaped caps that measure up to 3 cm (1.2 in) broad. The caps are orange-yellow to brownish, and attached to the decaying wood by short stubby stalks that are connected off-center or on the side of the caps. Strains from eastern North America are typically bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele.\nA common and widely distributed species, it is found in Eurasia, Australia, and North America, where it grows in groups or dense overlapping clusters on the logs, stumps, and trunks of deciduous trees, especially beech, oak, and birch. Modern research has probed the potential of P. stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first named Agaricus stypticus by the French botanist Jean Bulliard in 1783, and later sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries under this name in 1821. Fries later changed the genus as well as the spelling of the epithet and called it Panus stipticus. The species has had an extensive taxonomic history and been shuffled to a number of genera by various authors, resulting in several synonyms: Agaricus flabelliformis (Johann Friedrich Gmelin, 1792), Pocillaria stiptica (Otto Kuntze, 1898), Rhipidium stipticum (Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth, 1833), Crepidopus stipticus (Samuel Frederick Gray, 1821), Pleurotus stipticus (Paul Kummer), Lentinus stipticus (Joseph Schröter, 1885), and Merulius stipticus (Jean-Baptiste Lamarck). It was Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten who in 1879 assigned its current name. Panellus stypticus is still used in the literature as a variant spelling.\nPanellus stipticus is the type species of the genus Panellus, and, in Rolf Singer's authoritative 1986 classification of the Agaricales, it is also the type species of subgenus Panellus, an infrageneric (below the taxonomic level of genus) grouping of Panellus species characterized by the absence of cystidia on the sides of the gills. More recently, phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of their ribosomal large subunit genes have concluded that Panellus stipticus is closely related to the poroid mushroom Dictyopanus pusillus. The molecular analysis supports a previous assessment by mycologists Harold Bursdall and Orson K. Miller, who in 1975 suggested merging Dictyopanus into Panellus based on similarities in spore shape, stem structure, and the ability of dried fruit bodies to revive when moistened. Formerly grouped in the family Tricholomataceae, a wastebasket taxon of gilled mushrooms with white spores, P. stipticus is now classified in the Mycenaceae, after a large-scale phylogenetic analysis revealed \"a previously unsuspected relationship between Mycena and Panellus (including Dictyopanus)\".\nThe fungus is commonly known as the bitter oyster, the luminescent panellus, the astringent panus, or the styptic fungus. The specific epithet stipticus refers to its purported value in stopping bleeding. Etymologically, it is a Greek equivalent to the Latin word astringens, deriving from στυπτικός (styptikós), itself from the verb στύφειν (styphein), \"to contract\".",
    "Description": "The fungus normally exists unseen, in the form of a mass of threadlike vegetative cells called a mycelium, inhabiting rotting wood; only when suitable environmental conditions of temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are achieved does the fungus produce the reproductive structures known as fruit bodies, or mushrooms. The cap of the fruit body is kidney- or clamshell-shaped, convex to roughly flat, with dimensions of 1.2 to 3.2 cm (0.5 to 1.3 in) by 1.2 to 2.5 cm (0.5 to 1.0 in). The edges of the caps are scalloped with small rounded teeth, and curved slightly inward. The cap surface is dry, with a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked dried mud; the surface is also covered with small fine hairs that give it a somewhat woolly consistency. It may have several concentric ridges or zones. Fresh fruit bodies range in color from yellowish-orange to buff to cinnamon; when dried they may be various shades of tan, brown or clay. The faded colors of dried fruit bodies tend to revive when moistened. On the underside of the cap, the gills are narrow and spaced closely together, often forked, brownish to buff, and with numerous interconnecting cross-veins.\nSupporting the cap is a stem that is 0.5 to 2 cm (0.2 to 0.8 in) long by 0.3 to 0.8 cm (0.1 to 0.3 in) thick and has an off-center attachment to the cap, either at or near the cap side. The dull-white stem is covered with minute silk-like fibers and is narrower at the base where it attaches to the substrate. Fruit bodies do not have any distinctive odor. The flesh is thin, tough, and dark yellow-brown to cream-colored.",
    "Fruit body development": "Fruit bodies first appear as tiny white knobs less than a cubic millimeter in size. In a day or two the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by the formation of a minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1 mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, and then start to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile hymenium, which can be seen when the cap is about 2 mm in diameter.\n\nThe young cap is spherical and its growth is at first epinastic, its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special enclosed chamber. As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as 1.3 cm (0.5 in) broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown—a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.\nThe fruit body projects out horizontally from the growing surface. If the position of a log is altered after young fruit bodies with the beginnings of gills have appeared, the stems of these attempt to readjust themselves in order to place the cap in a horizontal position. The cap are sometimes zonate (marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones); this depends on changes in the humidity of the environment, as variations in the amount of moisture will cause alternating periods of acceleration or slowing of growth.\nA yellowish-brown pigment is diffused through the cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color just below the cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon the color of the cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.",
    "Reproduction": "Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each basidiospore develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., with all cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P. stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, the results revealed a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, as well as between and within Oceanian collections.",
    "Microscopic features": "Various microscopic characteristics may be used to help identify the fungus from other morphologically similar species. A spore print of P. stipticus, made by depositing a large number of spores in a small area, reveals their color to be white. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are smooth-walled, elliptical to nearly allantoid (sausage-shaped), with dimensions of 3–6 by 2–3 μm. Spores are amyloid, meaning that they will absorb iodine and become bluish-black when stained with Melzer's reagent, but this staining reaction has been described as \"relatively weak\".\nThe basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 15–20 by 2.5–3.5 μm, club-shaped, and clamped at the base. The spores are attached to the end of the basidia by four projections called sterigmata that are 1–3.5 μm long. Cystidia are hyphal cells in the hymenium that do not produce basidiospores; they also make up the surfaces of the fruit body (the pelli or \"cuticles\"). They are usually structurally distinct from the basidia, and their features may be used as microscopic characters to help distinguish and differentiate similar fungi.  The cheilocystidia are found on the gill edge; in P. stipticus they are narrowly club-shaped, cylindrical, spindle-shaped to bifurcate at the apex. They are also thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), abundant and crowded, and measure 17–45 by 3.5–6 μm. The pleurocystidia, located on the gill face, are 17–40 by 3–4.5 μm, spindle- or club-shaped, sometimes bifurcate at the apex, thin-walled, and hyaline. They are scattered or in dense clusters, mostly embedded in hymenium, occasionally protruding up to half the width of the hymenium.\nThe flesh of the cap consists of a number of microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10 μm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5 μm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65 μm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3 μm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221 μm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8 μm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520 μm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8 μm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The flesh of the cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8 μm. The flesh of the gills is similar to that of the lower cap.",
    "Similar species": "The relatives P. mitus (a rare West Coast species) and P. pusilis (distributed mostly in Florida) are similar.\nSpecies of Crepidotus having a similar shape can be distinguished by their brown spore print, compared with the white spore print of P. stipticus. Schizophyllum commune has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and longitudinally split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom (Panus rudis) is larger, has a reddish-brown cap that fades to pinkish-tan, and shows lilac tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some Paxillus species have a similar appearance, but can be distinguished by yellow-brown spore prints.",
    "Bioluminescence": "Bioluminescence is the ability of certain living things in the environment to produce light by the action of enzymes. Bioluminescent fungi are widespread, and over 70 species are known. Although the intensity of their luminescence is generally low compared to many other bioluminescent organisms, fungi glow continuously for days, so their total emission is comparable with that of most brightly luminescent organisms, such as fireflies. Luminous fungi are found growing on decaying wood, leading to the popular name of \"foxfire\" or \"glow wood\" when their glow is visible at night. The responsible oxidative enzymes—known generically as luciferases—produce light by oxidizing a pigment called a luciferin. In some areas, P. stypticus is bioluminescent, and the fruit bodies of these strains will glow in the dark when fresh or sometimes when revived in water after drying.\nAn early record of luminescence noted in P. stypticus was made by the American naturalist Thomas G. Gentry in 1885. Job Bicknell Ellis, reporting on the phenomenon for the Journal of Mycology, wrote:\n\nBy careful examination, the luminosity was found to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphorescence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.\nCanadian mycologist Buller in 1924 described the gills of P. stipticus in North America as luminescent, and noted that the fungus glows most strongly at the time of spore maturation. Bioluminescence has not been observed in European specimens, in Pacific North American collections, nor in strains collected from New Zealand, Russia, and Japan. Although a number of reports have confirmed that eastern North American strains are luminescent, non-luminescent North American strains are also known. In general, the intensity of fungal bioluminescence decreases after exposure to certain contaminants; this sensitivity is being investigated as a means to develop bioluminescence-based biosensors to test the toxicity of polluted soils. Most known luminescent fungi are in the genus Mycena or closely allied genera; this grouping of fungi—known as the \"mycenoid lineage\"—includes P. stipticus and three other Panellus species.",
    "Mycelia": "The mycelia of this species, grown in laboratory culture, have also been shown to be bioluminescent. Early studies demonstrated that short-wave ultraviolet light (at a wavelength of 280 nm) reversibly inhibited the luminescence of P. stypticus mycelia, while longer wavelength (366 nm) ultraviolet was stimulatory. Further, the fungus exhibited a pronounced diurnal periodicity, and maximum luminescence was noted between 6 and 9 pm, regardless as to whether the mycelial cultures were incubated in continuous light, continuous darkness, or a normal day-night cycle. The mycelia of P. stipticus grown submerged in liquid were non-luminescent, but became luminescent while growing on solid substrata. Dark-grown colonies were luminescent in the center, and light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery. Other experiments have shown that growth temperature and pH have a significant effect on the level of bioluminescence, optimized at 22 °C (72 °F) and pH 3–3.5. However, light had a significant effect on mycelial growth but not on bioluminescence, and the optimal light conditions for maximum bioluminescence were total darkness.",
    "Fruit bodies": "Bioluminescent tissue in the mature fruit body is restricted to the edge of the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.",
    "Genetics": "Using techniques of genetic complementation, Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, and concluded that luminosity in P. stipticus is an inherited character, and governed by a single pair of alleles in which luminosity was dominant over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different gene mutations could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525 nm, and shifted to 528 nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.\nAfter intercontinental compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes suggested that bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence seemed to be geographically restricted. This suggested that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of P. stypticus into geographically isolated areas.",
    "Function": "Several authors have suggested that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.",
    "Chemical basis": "In general, bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to play a critical role in the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.",
    "Distribution, habitat, and ecology": "Panellus stipticus is common in northern temperate regions of Europe, and has also been collected in Australia, New Zealand, Anatolia, Japan, and China. In North America, it is more common in the east than the west; the mushroom's northern range extends to Alaska, and it has been collected as far south as Costa Rica.\nPanellus stipticus is a saprobic species, and causes a white rot. This is a form of wood decay in which the wood assumes a bleached appearance and where lignin as well as cellulose and hemicellulose is broken down by enzymes secreted by the fungus.  Fruit bodies are usually found in tightly overlapping clusters on the sides of hardwood trees, on logs, stumps, and fallen branches. Although most commonly found on dead wood, it can also grow opportunistically in the wounds of living trees. In North America, its preferred hosts are oak, birch, maple, hickory, pecan, and American hornbeam, while in Europe, it is commonly found growing on oak, birch, alder, beech, hazel, chestnut, and ash. It has also been found growing on Ericia in North Africa. Although the fungus favors hardwoods, it has been reported to grow on loblolly pine and eastern white pine. Fruiting occurs September through November in Europe, the Canary Islands, and North America, although it may also sometimes be found in the spring. The fruit bodies are long-lasting and may be found year-round. It is an \"early-stage\" succession fungus, not typically recorded from plantations over 20 years old.\nThe fruit bodies are frequently attacked by slugs, which may be important agents in the dispersal of its spores. White-tailed deer are also known to consume the fungus.",
    "Uses": "Panellus stipticus is considered too small and bitter to be edible, but is considered nonpoisonous. Its taste has been described as acidic, acrid, or astringent. One 1992 study reported that the taste of the fruit bodies varies across the geographic range of the species. Those from eastern North America have a mildly acrid taste that takes time to develop, and cause uncomfortable drying in the mouth. In contrast, specimens from Japan, New Zealand, and Russia produce no sensation in the mouth, but cause significant constriction and a nauseating taste in the throat. The fruit bodies are reputed to have been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a styptic to staunch bleeding, and also as a \"violent purgative\".",
    "Bioremediation": "As a white-rot fungus, P. stipticus contains enzymes that are able to break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P. stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P. stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin."

  "Parmelia sulcata": {
    "Introduction": "Parmelia sulcata, commonly known as the hammered shield lichen or cracked-shield lichen, is a foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. First described by Thomas Taylor in 1836, it is one of the most prevalent lichen species globally, known for its resilience to pollution and cosmopolitan distribution across temperate and cold regions of both hemispheres. P. sulcata forms a circular thallus up to 10 cm (4 in) in diameter, with a glaucous white to grey upper surface and a black lower surface, featuring broadly lobed structures with both marginal and laminal soralia and a distinctive reticulate pattern of pseudocyphellae.\nTaxonomically, Parmelia sulcata has a complex history. Molecular phylogenetics studies have revealed significant genetic variability within what was traditionally considered a single species, identifying a complex of cryptic species, including Parmelia encryptata and P. barrenoae, and demonstrate the necessity of molecular data for accurate species identification. P. sulcata maintains a highly specific symbiotic relationship with green algae of the genus Trebouxia, particularly species within Trebouxia clade I, as its photobiont partner.\nEcologically, Parmelia sulcata grows on various substrates, including bark, wood, and rocks. It accumulates pollutants such as heavy metals and radionuclides, reflecting air quality and contamination levels, making it a useful bioindicator in pollution studies across Europe, North America, and other regions. Beyond its ecological importance, P. sulcata has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.",
    "Historical taxonomy": "Parmelia sulcata was first described by Thomas Taylor in 1836 under its current name. Taylor characterised its thallus as orbicular and stellate, with a glaucous (dull grayish-green) white colour when dry and a glaucous green colour when wet, and a dark brown underside with black fibres. He described the lobes as incised, somewhat concave, and reticulated  with elevated ridges. The thallus features oblong or linear eruptions consisting of a fine greyish-brown powder. Apothecia are central and substipitate, with a brown disk and a smooth or powdery exterior. Taylor noted that Parmelia sulcata was distinct from Parmelia saxatilis, being larger, whiter, less imbricated, more concave, and more green when wet. He also highlighted that the species is more common on rocks in County Kerry than on trees and could attain a diameter of a foot or more. Taylor mentioned that it had been previously mistaken for Parmelia conspersa (now in Xanthoparmelia) in some plant lists. Parmelia sulcata has a large number of named varieties and forms, but no subspecies despite its extensive range. Most taxonomists have left the species in the genus to which Taylor originally assigned it, though the mycologist Maurice Choisy assigned it to the genus Parmotrema in 1952.\nIn 1962, Mason Hale and Syo Kurokawa designated a specimen from Lough Bray, County Kerry, as the lectotype for Parmelia sulcata. This specimen, collected by Taylor in 1812 and housed in the Farlow Herbarium of Cryptogamic Botany, was supported by Taylor's own notes, confirming its identification. Despite attempts to extract DNA from the original lectotype, no viable DNA was obtained, leading to the selection of an epitype from a specimen collected near the original type locality in County Kerry in 2006. This epitype helps stabilize the application of the name Parmelia sulcata in both molecular and morphological studies.",
    "Molecular studies": "Molecular phylogenetics studies revealed significant genetic variability within Parmelia sulcata, indicating that it is a complex of cryptic species. Molina and colleagues (2011) used three molecular markers: nuclear internal transcribed spacer, abbreviated as nuITS; nuclear intergenic spacer rDNA, abbreviated as nuIGS; and partial β-tubulin gene to study the biodiversity of P. sulcata across four continents. They identified two monophyletic groups: Parmelia sulcata sensu stricto (\"in the strict sense\") and a new cryptic species named Parmelia encryptata. The study highlighted that P. sulcata as traditionally circumscribed did not form a monophyletic group. The researchers found that specimens initially identified as P. sulcata based on morphological characters did not cluster together in phylogenetic analyses. Instead, they formed distinct, well-supported clades, indicating the presence of multiple cryptic species within what was previously thought to be a single species. P. encryptata was described as morphologically similar to P. sulcata but genetically distinct, with a unique insertion in the internal transcribed spacer region and specific nucleotide differences. Another member of this complex, the widely distributed Parmelia barrenoae, was recognised as a distinct species in 2005.",
    "Naming": "The genus name Parmelia is a compound of two Greek words: parme, meaning 'fruit bowl' and -eileo, meaning 'enclosed'. This likely refers to the lecanorine apothecia of species belonging to the genus. The specific epithet sulcata is derived from sulcatus, meaning \"grooved\" or \"furrowed\". The species is known by a number of colloquial names, including hammered shield lichen, cracked-shield lichen, powdered crottle, furrowed shield lichen, powdered shield, and waxpaper lichen.",
    "Description": "Parmelia sulcata is a foliose lichen with a generally circular thallus that can range in color from glaucous white to gray on the upper cortex; the lower surface is black. The thallus is broadly lobed. The thallus, loosely attached to its substrate, is typically up to 6 cm (2+3⁄8 in), although diameters up to 10 cm (4 in) have been recorded. Each lobe measures between 2–5 mm (1⁄16–3⁄16 in) in width, and lobes are overlapping. The lobes, which are more or less linear, have both marginal and laminal soralia. Also present on both laminal and marginal regions of the lobes are elongated pseudocyphellae—small pores in the cortex—that form a reticulate pattern. Rhizines on the thallus underside are simple (unbranched) to squarrose (brush-like). Apothecia (fruiting bodies) are rare in this species. If present, they are up to 8 mm (5⁄16 in) in diameter and lecanorine in form, with a red-brown disc; they often have a sorediate margin. Reproduction in P. sulcata occurs predominantly asexually through soredia, although apothecia are not exceptionally rare in rural areas. Ascospores measure 8–14 μm.\nIn terms of standard spot tests, the upper surface of Parmelia sulcata reacts K+ (yellow), KC−, C−, and P−, indicating the presence of the secondary metabolites (lichen products) atranorin and chloroatranorin. The lichen's medulla and soredia  are K+ (red-orange)  and Pd+ (orange). The lichen does not fluoresce in ultraviolet light. Salazinic acid and consalazinic acid are present in the medulla; lobaric acid is variably present.",
    "Photobiont": "The photobiont, or photosynthetic partner, of Parmelia sulcata is primarily the green microalga Trebouxia. A 2021 study by Moya and colleagues shed light on the diversity and specificity of Trebouxia species associated with P. sulcata. Trebouxia is one of the most frequent lichen symbionts, associating with over 7,000 species of lichen-forming fungi worldwide. The study analyzed 159 thalli from 30 locations, including samples of P. sulcata. It was found that P. sulcata associates primarily with three Trebouxia lineages: Trebouxia sp. I02, T. flava, and Trebouxia aff. flava (a taxon closely related to, but not identical to, T. flava). This specificity suggests a close co-evolutionary relationship between Parmelia sulcata and its photobiont.\nPhylogenetic analyses revealed that while some Parmelia species can associate with multiple Trebouxia species, P. sulcata maintains a more specialised relationship with fewer Trebouxia lineages. This high specificity could be related to the lichen's ecological strategies and vegetative structures. Parmelia sulcata reproduces vegetatively through soredia, which contain both fungal and algal cells, potentially influencing the selection of compatible photobionts. Overall, the study suggests that the biodiversity patterns of photobionts in Parmelia are influenced by a combination of ecological, climatic, and evolutionary factors.",
    "Similar species": "Parmelia sulcata has several morphologically and chemically similar species that can be challenging to distinguish without detailed examination and molecular data. These species include Parmelia barrenoae, Parmelia encryptata, and Parmelia asiatica. Identifying Parmelia sulcata and its similar species based solely on morphology and chemistry can be challenging due to overlapping characteristics and intraspecific variability. DNA-based methods are essential tools to help distinguish between cryptic species like P. encryptata and near-cryptic species such as P. asiatica and P. barrenoae. Understanding these differences enables researchers and lichenologists to better identify and study Parmelia sulcata and its closely related species, contributing to more accurate distribution records and ecological knowledge.\nParmelia barrenoae can be distinguished by its broad and overlapping lobes. The soralia are laminal, appearing as fissures in the upper cortex. The rhizines of P. barrenoae are simple to furcate. While both P. barrenoae and P. sulcata contain salazinic acid, the physical arrangement and appearance of lobes and soralia are distinguishing features.\nParmelia encryptata is a cryptic species that is morphologically identical to P. sulcata. It is characterised by sublinear lobes with marginal and laminal, elongated pseudocyphellae, and soralia on the upper surface. The rhizines are typically simple to squarrose, predominantly simple in the central part of the thallus. Identification of P. encryptata requires molecular data, specifically nucITS rDNA sequences, to distinguish it from P. sulcata.\nParmelia asiatica is distinguished by its predominantly circular and semicircular, terminal, or marginal soralia, and narrow sublinear lobes. Like P. sulcata, P. asiatica has simple to squarrose rhizines but differs in the shape and distribution of its soralia. Both species have salazinic acid in the medulla, but the unique characteristics of P. asiatica's soralia and lobes provide a visual distinction.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Parmelia sulcata is a common species throughout much of the world, found from temperate to cold regions of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Its northern North American distribution has been described as \"extremely widespread, even weedy\", and includes Mexico's Baja California. It is one of the most common parmelioid lichens in Europe, having been recorded in 43 countries there. It has been found to reappear in urban areas after sulphur dioxide levels have decreased. Although common in the Northern Hemisphere, Parmelia sulcata is rare in South America. A 2023 study provided molecular evidence for its presence in Chile, and showed that DNA sequences from Chile belong to the most common haplotype found in Europe, Asia, and North America, indicating a widespread distribution of this haplotype. In Africa, Parmelia sulcata has been documented from the low alpine zone in Ethiopia and Kenya, at elevations ranging from 3,500 to 4,200 m (11,500 to 13,800 ft), but it is otherwise rare.\nAlthough most common on bark and on wood, Parmelia sulcata also grows on rocks or mossy rocks. In a study of the distribution of epiphytic lichens, including Parmelia sulcata, along tree trunks in a temperate continental climate, it was found to be most abundant in the middle to upper parts of tree trunks, particularly in areas with higher light levels. This distribution pattern suggests that light conditions are a significant factor influencing the growth and distribution of Parmelia sulcata.",
    "Ecology": "The vertical zonality of Parmelia sulcata along tree trunks is influenced by various microclimatic conditions such as humidity, light conditions, and the chemical and physical properties of the bark. Parmelia sulcata, along with other lichen species, contributes to the high diversity of lichen biota in the lower and upper parts of tree trunks. The species composition of lichens, including Parmelia sulcata, changes from the base to the crown of the trees, indicating the importance of light conditions in their distribution. For instance, in a Russian study, Parmelia sulcata was commonly found at heights of 10–20 m (33–66 ft) on birch trees and around 15 m (49 ft) and in the crown on spruce trees, reflecting its preference for higher insolation levels (i.e., areas that receive more sunlight or solar radiation) in these zones.\nA study conducted in a temperate deciduous forest of Central Italy monitored carbon dioxide (CO2) gas exchange, radial growth, chlorophyll content, and photobiont density of Parmelia sulcata over a year. The results showed significant seasonal variations, with CO2 gas exchange and radial growth peaking in December, and photoinhibition occurring in early spring before tree leaves sprouted. Photobiont density was highest in June and December and lowest in April. These findings suggest that the seasonal acclimation of lichen photosynthesis and chlorophyll content is influenced by variations in photobiont population density, potentially related to changes in nutrient availability.\nLichenoconium edgewoodense and Nanostictis caucasica are two species of lichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungi that have been recorded exclusively parasitising Parmelia barrenoae, although it is also susceptible to other species of parasitic fungi that more broadly target genus Parmelia, such as Arthophacopsis parmeliarum or Abrothallus parmeliarum. Another fungus that appears to be obligately parasitic on P. sulcata, Perigrapha superveniens, causes the formation of irregularly shaped to undulate (wavy edged) galls, and prefers its host to live in oceanic areas.",
    "Dyestuff": "This species can be used to make a natural dye, producing a reddish-brown colour. Its use as a dyestuff has a long history in Scotland, where lichens of genus Parmelia were traditionally known as \"crotal\" (from Gaelic crotal), with P. saxatalis being called \"light crotal\" and related species P. omphalodes being known as \"dark crotal\". The traditional Highland dyeing method involved alternating layers of lichen and wool in a dyeing vessel, covered with water and boiled until the desired depth of colour was achieved. While this produced strong, permanent colours, the continuous boiling could damage the wool fibres. Later methods solved this by first boiling the crotal alone to extract the colour, then adding the wool at a lower temperature to prevent tangling and damage.",
    "Traditional medicine": "In Canada, the Métis peoples rubbed it on the gums of teething babies, while the Saanich peoples used it as a folk medicine.",
    "Environmental monitoring": "Parmelia sulcata has been extensively studied for its capacity to monitor environmental pollution due to its sensitivity to air quality changes. As a species sensitive to air quality changes, its presence or absence can indicate pollution levels, particularly in industrial areas, urban settings, and natural habitats. It has been observed to reappear in areas where sulfur dioxide levels have decreased, making it a useful bioindicator of improving air conditions.\nAdditionally, P. sulcata can accumulate and concentrate various pollutants in its tissues, allowing researchers to quantify contamination levels. Studies have used it to monitor heavy metals in industrial areas and persistent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in the Pyrenees. Its ability to accumulate radionuclides has also made it valuable for measuring radioactive pollutants, with researchers analysing the concentrations of radionuclides in the lichen's tissues to assess environmental pollution levels in affected areas.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Paxillus involutus": {
    "Introduction": "Paxillus involutus, also known as the brown roll-rim or the common roll-rim, is a species of basidiomycete fungus. Although it has gills, it is more closely related to the pored boletes than to typical gilled mushrooms. It was first described by Pierre Bulliard in 1785, and was given its current binomial name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. Genetic testing suggests that Paxillus involutus may be a species complex rather than a single species. Various shades of brown in colour, the fruit body grows up to 6 cm (2+3⁄8 in) high and has a funnel-shaped cap up to 12 cm (4+3⁄4 in) wide with a distinctive inrolled rim and decurrent gills that may be pore-like close to the stipe.\nThe species is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere. It has been inadvertently introduced to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and South America, probably transported in soil with European trees. It is common in deciduous and coniferous woods and grass in late summer and autumn, forming ectomycorrhizal relationships with a broad range of tree species. These benefit from the symbiosis as the fungus reduces their intake of heavy metals and increases resistance to pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum.\nPreviously considered edible and eaten in parts of Europe, it has been found to be deadly poisonous, after being responsible for the death of German mycologist Julius Schäffer in 1944. It had been recognized as causing gastric upsets when eaten raw, but was more recently found to cause potentially fatal autoimmune hemolysis, even in those who had consumed the mushroom for years without any other ill effects. An unknown antigen in the mushroom triggers the immune system to attack red blood cells. Serious and commonly fatal complications include acute kidney injury, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was described by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1785 as Agaricus contiguus, although the 1786 combination Agaricus involutus of August Batsch is taken as the first valid description. James Bolton published a description of what he called Agaricus adscendibus in 1788; the taxonomical authority Index Fungorum considers this to be synonymous with P. involutus. Additional synonyms include Omphalia involuta described by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, and Rhymovis involuta, published by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst in 1844. The species gained its current binomial name in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries erected the genus Paxillus, and set it as the type species. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. It was thus written Paxillus involutus (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the Species Plantarum. Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.\nThe genus was later placed in a new family, Paxillaceae, by French mycologist René Maire who held it to be related to both agarics and boletes. Although it has gills rather than pores, it has long been recognised as belonging to the pored mushrooms of the order Boletales rather than the traditional agarics. The generic name is derived from the Latin for 'peg' or 'plug', and the specific epithet involutus, 'inrolled', refers to the cap margin. Common names include the naked brimcap, poison paxillus, inrolled pax, poison pax, common roll-rim, brown roll-rim, and brown chanterelle. Gray called it the \"involved navel-stool\" in his 1821 compendium of British flora.\nStudies of the ecology and genetics of Paxillus involutus indicate that it may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries found that there were three populations of P. involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. There were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P. vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P. filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P. involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P. obscurosporus, P. involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P. validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.",
    "Description": "Resembling a brown wooden top, the epigeous (aboveground) fruit body may be up to 6 cm (2+1⁄4 in) tall. The cap, initially convex then more funnel-shaped (infundibuliform) with a depressed centre and rolled rim (hence the common name), may be reddish-, yellowish- or olive-brown in colour and typically 4–12 cm (1+5⁄8–4+3⁄4 in) wide; the cap diameter does not get larger than 15 cm (6 in). The cap surface is initially downy and later smooth, becoming sticky when wet. The cap and cap margin initially serve to protect the gills of young fruit bodies: this is termed pilangiocarpic development. The narrow brownish yellow gills are decurrent and forked, and can be peeled easily from the flesh (as is the case with the pores of boletes). Gills further down toward the stipe become more irregular and anastomose, and can even resemble the pores of bolete-type fungi. The fungus darkens when bruised and older specimens may have darkish patches. The juicy yellowish flesh has a mild to faintly sour or sharp odor and taste, and has been described as well-flavored upon cooking. Of similar colour to the cap, the short stipe measures some 3–6 cm tall and 1–3 wide, can be crooked, and tapers toward the base.\n\nThe spore print is brown, and the dimensions of the ellipsoid (oval-shaped) spores are 7.5–9 by 5–6 μm. The hymenium has cystidia both on the gill edge and face (cheilo- and pleurocystidia respectively), which are slender and filament-like, typically measuring 40–65 by 8–10.5 μm.",
    "Similar species": "The brownish colour and funnel-like shape of P. involutus can lead to its confusion with several species of Lactarius, many of which have some degree of toxicity themselves. The lack of a milky exudate distinguishes it from any milk cap. One of the more similar is L. turpis, which presents a darker olive colouration. The related North American Paxillus vernalis has a darker spore print, thicker stipe and is found under aspen, whereas the closer relative P. filamentosus is more similar in appearance to P. involutus. A rare species that grows only in association with alder, P. filamentosus can be distinguished from it by the pressed-down scales on the cap surface that point towards the cap margin, a light yellow flesh that bruises only slightly brown, and deep yellow-ochre gills that do not change colour upon injury\nThe most similar species are two once thought to be part of P. involutus in Europe. Paxillus obscurisporus (originally obscurosporus) has larger fruit bodies than P. involutus, with caps up to 40 cm (16 in) wide whose margins tend to unroll and flatten with age, and a layer of cream-coloured mycelia covering the base of its tapered stipe. P. validus, also known only from Europe, has caps up to 20 cm (7+7⁄8 in) wide with a stipe that is more or less equal in width throughout its length. Found under broadleaved trees in parks, it can be reliably distinguished from P. involutus (and other Paxillus species) by the presence of crystals up to 2.5 μm long in the rhizomorphs, as the crystals found in rhizomorphs of other Paxillus species do not exceed 0.5 μm long.\nOther similar species include Phylloporus arenicola, Tapinella atrotomentosa, and Tapinella panuoides.",
    "Ecology, distribution and habitat": "Paxillus involutus forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with a number of coniferous and deciduous tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialized nutrient requirements and a relatively broad host specificity, it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs. There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where P. involutus was cultivated on the root exudate of red pine (Pinus resinosa), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Seedlings inoculated with P. involutus also showed increased resistance to Fusarium. Thus P. involutus may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot. Paxillus involutus also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against heavy metal toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of cadmium and zinc to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits ectomycorrhiza formation in seedlings, colonization with P. involutus decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal cell walls, as well as accumulating in the vacuolar compartments. Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to copper or cadmium drastically increase production of a metallothionein—a low molecular weight protein that binds metals.\nThe presence of Paxillus involutus is related to much reduced numbers of bacteria associated with the roots of Pinus sylvestris. Instead bacteria are found on the external mycelium. The types of bacteria change as well; a Finnish study published in 1997 found that bacterial communities under P. sylvestris without mycorrhizae metabolised organic and amino acids, while communities among P. involutus metabolised the sugar fructose. Paxillus involutus benefits from the presence of some species of bacteria in the soil it grows in. As the fungus grows it excretes polyphenols, waste products that are toxic to itself and impede its growth, but these compounds are metabolised by some bacteria, resulting in increased fungal growth. Bacteria also produce certain compounds such as citric and malic acid, which stimulate P. involutus.\n\nHighly abundant, the species is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is equally widely distributed across northern North America, extending north to Alaska, where it has been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana, B. pubescens and B. glandulosa. The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (Betula pendula). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids calcareous (chalky) soils. It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe, and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of white birch (Betula papyrifera) in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their natural range. A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P. involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles.\nPaxillus involutus can be found growing on lawns and old meadows throughout its distribution. Fruit bodies are generally terrestrial, though they may be found on woody material around tree stumps. They generally appear in autumn and late summer. In California, David Arora discerned a larger form associated with oak and pine which appears in late autumn and winter, as well as the typical form that is associated with birch plantings and appears in autumn. Several species of flies and beetles have been recorded using the fruit bodies to rear their young. The mushroom can be infected by Hypomyces chrysospermus, or bolete eater, a mould species that parasitises Boletales members. Infection results in the appearance of a whitish powder that first manifests on the pores, then spreads over the surface of the mushroom, becoming golden yellow to reddish-brown in maturity.\nAustralian mycologist John Burton Cleland noted it occurring under larch (Larix), oak, pine, birch and other introduced trees in South Australia in 1934, and it has subsequently been recorded in New South Wales, Victoria (where it was found near Betula and Populus) and Western Australia. It has been recorded under introduced birch (Betula) and hazel (Corylus) in New Zealand. Mycologist Rolf Singer reported a similar situation in South America, with the species recorded under introduced trees in Chile. It is likely to have been transported to those countries in the soil of imported European trees.",
    "Toxicity": "Paxillus involutus was widely eaten in Central and Eastern Europe until World War II, although English guidebooks did not recommend it. In Poland, the mushroom was often eaten after pickling or salting. It was known to be a gastrointestinal irritant when ingested raw but had been presumed edible after cooking. Questions were first raised about its toxicity after German mycologist Julius Schäffer died after eating it in October 1944. About an hour after he and his wife ate a meal prepared with the mushrooms, Schäffer developed vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. His condition worsened to the point where he was admitted to hospital the following day and developed kidney failure, perishing after 17 days.\nIn the mid-1980s, Swiss physician René Flammer discovered an antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own red blood cells as foreign and attack them. Despite this, it was not until 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P. involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as late as 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom for a long period of time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.\nPoisoning symptoms are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin in the urine or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing for the presence of increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute kidney injury, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.\nThere is no antidote for poisoning, only supportive treatment consisting of monitoring complete blood count, renal function, blood pressure, and fluid and electrolyte balance and correcting abnormalities. The use of corticosteroids may be a useful adjunct in treatment, as they protect blood cells against hemolysis, thereby reducing complications. Plasmapheresis reduces the circulating immune complexes in the blood which cause the hemolysis, and may be beneficial in improving the outcome. Additionally, hemodialysis can be used for patients with compromised kidney function or kidney failure.\nPaxillus involutus also contains agents which appear to damage chromosomes; it is unclear whether these have carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Two compounds that have been identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter is responsible for the brownish discolouration upon bruising.\nDespite the poisonings, Paxillus involutus is still consumed in parts of Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, where people die from it every year."

  "Peltigera aphthosa": {
    "Introduction": "Peltigera aphthosa is a species of lichen known by the common names green dog lichen, leafy lichen, felt lichen, and common freckle pelt. It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring throughout the Arctic, boreal, and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\nThis lichen has a large thallus that may exceed one meter in width. It is divided into lobes up to about 10 centimeters long and 6 wide. It is green, becoming pale as it dries. The thallus is dotted with cephalodia, which contains one of the two symbionts, a species of Nostoc. The other is a species of Coccomyxa. These perform photosynthesis, and the Nostoc also fixes nitrogen. The lichen produces large apothecia, a reproductive structure.\nThis widespread lichen grows in a variety of habitat types, including Arctic ecosystems. It grows in alpine climates in the southern parts of its distribution.\nThis lichen was noted to absorb aluminum and silicon from the ash released from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.\nIt is a known host to the lichenicolous fungus species Lichenopeltella santessonii."

  "Peltigera praetextata": {
    "Introduction": "Peltigera praetextata, or the scaly dog pelt lichen, is a foliose lichen native to North America, Europe, and Asia. It is defined by small belly-button-like growths called phyllidia on its edges and centre.",
    "Characteristics": "Peltigera praetextata has flat lobes up to 5 cm (2 in) long, and often forms circular growth patterns. It is dark green when wet, often with a reddish centre, and greyish when dry. It is tomentous, or covered with fine hairs. It does not reproduce vegetatively using isidia or soredia like most lichens, but using phyllidia. It is often fertile as well, with round to saddle-shaped red apothecial discs.",

  "Phaeolus schweinitzii": {
    "Introduction": "Phaeolus schweinitzii, commonly known as velvet-top fungus, dyer's polypore, dyer's mazegill, or pine dye polypore, is a fungal plant pathogen.",
    "Taxonomy": "P. schweinitzii is named after Lewis David de Schweinitz, a Pennsylvania-born Moravian minister and important early American mycologist.",
    "Description": "P. schweinitzii is a polypore, although unlike bracket fungi the fruiting body may appear terrestrial when growing from the roots or base of the host tree.\nThe fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow. They are tannish with darker brown centres, with orange to pale margins on young specimens. They may grow beyond 25 centimetres (10 in) in diameter. As the fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the yellow-brown flesh becomes harder and more wood-like. The pores bruise brown. The spores are white, elliptical, smooth, and inamyloid.\nThe effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose.  Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay.  Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include Heterobasidion irregulare, H. occidentale, Inonotus dryophilus, and Onnia tomentosa.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "P. schweinitzii causes butt rot on conifers such as Douglas-fir, spruce, fir, hemlock, pine, and larch. It is native to North America and Eurasia, and has been identified as an exotic species in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa.",
    "Uses": "As its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown dye, depending on the material dyed and the mordant used.\nThe species is not edible.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Phallus impudicus": {
    "Introduction": "Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as the common stinkhorn, is a widespread species of fungus in the Phallaceae (stinkhorn) family. It is recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England.\nIt is a common mushroom in Europe and North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris, such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion.\nDespite its foul smell, it is not usually poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed cooked on their own or feature as an ingredient in cuisines of parts of the Czech Republic, France and Germany.",
    "Taxonomy": "The Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi described the fungus in 1560 with name fungus priapeus, and he depicted it in his series of water-coloured plates called teatro della natura ('nature's theater' 1560–1590). Another botanist, John Gerard called it the \"pricke mushroom\" or \"fungus virilis penis effigie\" in his General Historie of Plants of 1597, and John Parkinson referred to it as \"Hollanders workingtoole\" or \"phallus hollandicus\" in his Theatrum botanicum of 1640. Linnaeus described it in his 1753 Species Plantarum, and it still bears its original binomial name. Its specific epithet, impudicus, is derived from the Latin for \"shameless\" or \"immodest\".",
    "Description": "Sometimes called the witch's egg, the immature stinkhorn is whitish or pinkish, egg-shaped, and typically 4 to 6 cm (1+1⁄2 to 2+1⁄4 in) by 3 to 5 cm (1+1⁄4 to 2 in). On the outside is a thick whitish volva, also known as the peridium, covering the olive-colored gelatinous gleba. It is the latter that contains the spores and later stinks and attracts the flies; within this layer is a green layer which will become the 'head' of the expanded fruit body; and inside this is a white structure called the receptaculum (the stalk when expanded), that is hard, but has an airy structure like a sponge. The eggs become fully grown stinkhorns very rapidly, over a day or two.\nThe mature stinkhorn is 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in) tall and 4 to 5 cm (1+1⁄2 to 2 in) in diameter, topped with a conical cap 2 to 4 cm (3⁄4 to 1+1⁄2 in) high that is covered with the greenish-brown slimy gleba. In older fungi the slime is eventually removed, exposing a bare yellowish pitted and ridged (reticulate) surface. This has a passing resemblance to the common morel (Morchella esculenta), for which it is sometimes mistaken. The rate of growth of Phallus impudicus has been measured at 10–15 cm (4–6 in) per hour. The growing fruit body is able to exert up to 1.33 kPa of pressure—a force sufficient to push up through asphalt. The spores have an elliptical to oblong shape, with dimensions of 3–5 to 1.5–2.5 μm.",
    "Similar species": "In North America, P. impudicus can be distinguished from the very similar P. hadriani by the latter's purplish-tinted volva.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The common stinkhorn can be found throughout much of Europe and North America, and it has also been collected in Asia (including China, Taiwan, and India), Costa Rica, Iceland, Tanzania, and southeast Australia. In North America, it is most common west of the Mississippi River; Ravenel's stinkhorn (Phallus ravenelii) is more common to the east. The fungus is associated with rotting wood, and as such it is most commonly encountered in deciduous woods where it fruits from summer to late autumn, though it may also be found in conifer woods or even grassy areas such as parks and gardens. It may also form mycorrhizal associations with certain trees.",
    "Ecology": "Unlike many mushrooms which spread their spores through the air, stinkhorns produce a sticky spore mass on their tip which has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion to attract flies and other insects. Odorous chemicals in the gleba include methanethiol, hydrogen sulfide, linalool, trans-ocimene, phenylacetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide. The latter compound has been found to be emitted from fungating cancerous wounds. The mature fruiting bodies can be smelled from a considerable distance in the woods, and at close quarters most people find the cloying stink extremely repulsive. The flies land in the gleba and in doing so collect the spore mass on their legs and carry it to other locations.\nAn Austrian study demonstrated that blow-flies (species Calliphora vicina, Lucilia caesar, Lucilia ampullacea and Dryomyza anilis) also feed on the slime, and soon after leaving the fruit body, they deposit liquid feces that contain a dense suspension of spores. The study also showed that beetles (Oeceoptoma thoracica and Meligethes viridescens) are attracted to the fungus, but seem to have less of a role in spore dispersal as they tend to feed on the hyphal tissue of the fruiting body.\n\nThere is also a possible ecological association between the P. impudicus and badger (Meles meles) setts. Fruiting bodies are commonly clustered in a zone 24 to 39 metres (79 to 128 ft) from the entrances; the setts typically harbor a regularly-available supply of badger cadavers. The mortality rate of cubs is high and death is more likely to occur within the sett. The fruiting of large numbers of stinkhorns attracts a high population of blow-flies (Calliphora and Lucilla breed on carrion); this ensures the rapid elimination of badger carcasses, removing a potential source of disease to the badger colony. The laxative effect of the gleba reduces the distance from the fruiting body to where the spores are deposited, ensuring the continued production of high densities of stinkhorns.",
    "Uses": "At the egg stage, pieces of the inner layer (the receptaculum) can be cut out with a knife and eaten raw. They are crisp and crunchy with an attractive radishy taste. Some sources differ as to its palatability.\nThe fungus is enjoyed and eaten in France and parts of Germany, where it may be sold fresh or pickled and used in sausages. Similar species are consumed in China.",
    "Medicinal properties": "Venous thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P. impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventive nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.",
    "In culture": "In Northern Montenegro, peasants rub P. impudicus on the necks of bulls before bullfighting contests in an attempt to make them stronger. They are also fed to young bulls as they are thought to be a potent aphrodisiac.\nIn 1777, the reverend John Lightfoot wrote that the people of Thuringia called the unopened stinkhorns \"ghost's or daemon's eggs\" and dried and powdered them before mixing them in spirits as an aphrodisiac.\n\nWriting about life in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of Charles Darwin) describes the 'sport' of stinkhorn hunting: In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular The Stinkhorn, though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she caught a whiff of her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids.\nIn Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, the psychologist Dr. Krokowski gives a lecture on the species:\n\nAnd Dr. Krokowski had spoken about one fungus, famous since classical antiquity for its form and the powers ascribed to it – a morel, its Latin name ending in the adjective impudicus, its form reminiscent of love, and its odor, of death. For the stench given off by the impudicus was strikingly like that of a decaying corpse, the odor coming from greenish, viscous slime that carried its spores and dripped from the bell-shaped cap. And even today, among the uneducated, this morel was thought to be an aphrodisiac.\nIn Danilo Kiš's novel Garden, Ashes, the protagonist's father provokes the suspicions of the local residents and authorities through his mad wandering and sermonizing in the forests:\n\nThe story went round, and was preached from the pulpit, that his iron-tipped cane possessed magical powers, that trees withered like grass whenever he walked in the Count's forest, that his spit produced poisonous mushrooms --Ithyphalus impudicus--that grew under the guise of edible, cultivated varieties."

  "Phellinus igniarius": {
    "Introduction": "Phellinus igniarius (syn. Phellinus trivialis), commonly known as the willow bracket, fire sponge, false tinder polypore, punk ash polypore, or false tinder conk, is a fungus of the family Hymenochaetaceae. Like other members of the genus of Phellinus, it lives by saprotrophic nutrition, in which the lignin and cellulose of a host tree is degraded and is a cause of white rot.\nThe fungus forms perennial fruiting bodies that rise as woody-hard, hoof or disc-shaped brackets from the bark of the infested living tree or dead log. The tree species is often willow but it may be commonly found on birch and alder and other broad leafed trees. The top is covered with a dark, often cracked crust, a stem is present only in its infancy. Unlike most fungi, it has a hard woody consistency and may persist for many years, building a new surface layer each year.",
    "Description": "The bracket measures 5–20 centimetres (2–8 in) in diameter, but in rare cases may be 40 cm wide. The thickness of the bracket varies from 2–12 cm (1–4+1⁄2 in), to 20 cm in exceptional cases. These conks are among the longest persisting fungal fruit bodies, displaying up to eighty annual growth rings. The fungus has small, grayish brown pores, about 4–6 per square millimetre. Its tubes have a length of about 2–7 mm (1⁄8–1⁄4 in). Each year, the fungus forms a new layer of tubes superimposed on the old layers. Unreleased old spores often find themselves sealed in by later growth that clog the tubes and they appear in cross section as brown spots.\nThe brown flesh is 10–20 cm (4–8 in) thick and becomes harder with age and dryness, softer with humidity. The smell of the fruit body has a pronounced mushroom character, the flavor of the meat is bitter. Upon contact with potassium hydroxide, the flesh is dyed black. The spores form a whitish cast.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include P. arctostaphyli, P. pomaceoides, P. tremulae, Fulvifomes robiniae, and members of Fomitiporia.",
    "Ecology": "The species is a polypore, with pores on the underside that bear basidiospores. The species causes a white rot that leads to the tree to decay. Woodpeckers are known to favour its site as a good place to excavate a nesting chamber since the wood will be soft and weaker around its location.",
    "Uses": "The species is considered to be inedible, being woodlike. There is some evidence that it may have potential medicinal uses. A 2014 study in mice suggests an extract of the mushroom fruit body may have a high therapeutic potential for ameliorating multiple sclerosis progression.\nIt was prized as kindling material. In Alaska, it is burnt by locals, and the ash (punk ash) is mixed with chewing tobacco to enhance the effect of the nicotine."

    "Taxonomy": "The fungus was originally described in 1794 by German botanist Heinrich Adolf Schrader, who called it Merulius tremellosus. Nakasone and Burdsall transferred the taxon to the genus Phlebia in 1984, when they placed Merulius in synonymy.\nIt is commonly known as the \"trembling Merulius\", or \"jelly rot\".",

They have a spongy to fibrous texture, comprising stalkless caps or spreading crusts. The upper surface, white to pale yellow in colour, can be dry to moist, and hairy to woolly; the margin is usually white to translucent. The undersurface, bearing the fertile hymenium, features radiating to wrinkled ridges and cross veins, and often forms pore-like depressions on mature specimens. Its colour is yellowish orange or pinkish orange. The flesh of this fungus is about 2 mm thick, with a fleshy to gelatinous texture and white to yellowish colour.\nThe visual similarity of the fungus to bacon gives rise to the Dutch common name bacon-pork rind mushroom, although it is inedible.",

Both the cap and the stem are covered in small, pointed scales that are pointed downward and backward. The crowded gills are yellowish, then later rust-brown. The mushroom has an odor that, depending on the author, has been described as resembling garlic, lemon, radish, onion, or skunk. It has a strong taste, resembling radishes. The very similar P. squarrosoides differs in having a paler cap that is sticky between the scales, and smaller spores.\nCommon in North America and Europe, it is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It has a wide range of hosts among deciduous trees, although it can also infect conifers. It can also live as a saprobe, deriving nutrients from decomposing wood. Though edible to some, it may be toxic, especially if consumed in combination with alcohol. The mushroom contains unique chemicals thought to help it infect plants by neutralizing defensive responses employed by them.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described scientifically as Agaricus squarrosus in 1790 by Georg Christian Oeder, and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum. It was transferred to the genus Pholiota by the German Paul Kummer. It is the type species of the genus Pholiota.\nThe specific epithet squarrosa is derived from Latin, and means \"scurfy\". The mushroom is commonly known as the \"scaly Pholiota\", the \"shaggy scalycap\", or the \"shaggy Pholiota\".",
    "Description": "Like other Pholiota mushrooms, P. squarrosa has a scaly cap and stem. The cap ranges from 3 to 12 cm (1.2 to 4.7 in) in diameter, and depending on its age, can range in shape from bell-shaped to rounded to somewhat flattened. The cap color is yellowish-brown to tawny in older specimens. The scales on the cap are yellowish to tawny, and recurved.\nThe stem is 4 to 12 cm (1.6 to 4.7 in) long by 0.5 to 1.5 cm (0.20 to 0.59 in) thick, and roughly equal in width throughout. The partial veil that covers the young gills forms a thick, woolly ring on the upper part of the stem. Above the level of the ring, the stem is bare, while below it is scaly like the cap. The gills are covered by a partial veil when young and have a greenish-brown color; mature gills are rusty brown. They are crowded closely together, attached to the stem (adnate), and usually notched (sinuate).\nThe spore print is cinnamon or rusty brown. The spores are elliptic, smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6–8 by 3.7–4.4 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16–25 by 5–7 μm.\nFruit bodies have an odour described variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish.",
    "Similar species": "Pholiota squarrosa is similar in appearance to species in the genus Armillaria, but the latter produces white spore prints. Another similar mushroom is Pholiota squarrosoides, which can be distinguished microscopically by its smaller spores, and macroscopically by the stickiness of the cap between the scales. P. squarrosoides also lacks the odor of P. squarrosa, and has flesh that is white, not yellow. Leucopholiota decorosa can also be misidentified with P. squarrosa; it has white, adnexed gills with finely scalloped edges, but it can be distinguished most reliably by its white, nonamyloid spores.\nOther similar species include Pholiota aurivella, P. populnea, and P. terrestris.",
    "Ecology, habitat and distribution": "The mushroom is typically found growing in clusters at the base of trees and stumps.\nPholiota squarrosa is thought to be a white rot fungus, which use cellulose as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.\nP. squarrosa is found in North America and Europe. The North American distribution extends north to Canada, and south to Mexico, where its appearance is restricted to coniferous forests. In the Netherlands, P. squarrosa is one of many mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber wharves.\nThe fruit bodies are used as a primary food source by the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, and have a higher protein content than the other mushrooms typically consumed by this species. Decaying fruit bodies are also used as a food source by fruit flies of the genus Drosophila.",
    "Edibility": "Although some sources report P. squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect may be due to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.",
    "Chemistry": "The fruit bodies contain unique chemical compounds that are derived from phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection."

On the cap underside are crowded orange gills. Mock oyster mushrooms have an unpleasant odor and are regarded as inedible.\nIt is widely dispersed in temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, where it grows on decaying wood.",
    "Taxonomy": "The mock oyster was first described scientifically in 1798 by Christian Hendrik Persoon as Agaricus nidulans. The specific epithet nidulans means \"partly encased or lying in a cavity\". It is commonly known as \"nestcap\". It is the type species of the genus Phyllotopsis.",
    "Description": "The caps are 2–10 centimetres (3⁄4–4 in) wide. The stems are either very short or nonexistent. The flesh has a thiol-like odor similar to rotten cabbage or rotten eggs.\nThe spore print is pink to tannish. The smooth, sausage-shaped to cylindrical basidiospores measure 5–7 μm long by 2–3 μm wide. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.",
    "Chemistry": "The predominant pigments in the fruit bodies include beta-carotene (58%), alpha-carotene (29%), echinenone (8%), and astaxanthin (4%). P. nidulans also produces a unique amino acid, 3-(3-carboxyfuran-4-yl) l-alanine.",
    "Similar species": "Phyllotopsis subnidulans, found in the eastern United States, is similar in appearance. It can be distinguished by a deeper orange color, thinner gills with wider inter-gill spacing, and curved to sausage-shaped spores. Other similar species include Lentinellus ursinusus, Crepidotus mollis, Panus rudis, Panus conchatus, and Pleurotus ostreatus.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Fruit bodies grow singly or in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Phyllotopsis nidulans is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its range extends north to Alaska, and includes Costa Rica, where it has been recorded in the Talamanca mountains and on the Poas Volcano. In Asia, it has been recorded in Korea.",

  "Physcia adscendens": {
    "Introduction": "Physcia adscendens, the hooded rosette lichen, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Physciaceae. Originally described in 1882, this widely distributed lichen is characterised by its distinctive hood-shaped lobes that curl upward at the tips and long dark-tipped hairs growing from underneath. The species has a broad ecological tolerance and can colonise various substrates, from limestone monuments to tree bark, contributing to its success as a pioneer species following environmental disturbances.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was described as a new species by the French botanist Henri Jacques François Olivier in 1882. In his original description, Olivier noted that Physcia adscendens has an ashy white or blue-gray body (thallus) that is narrowly divided into segments. He described these segments as growing upward in crowded, overlapping layers, with numerous hair-like projections along the edges that are either the same colour as the main body or slightly darker at the tips. Olivier observed that the spore-producing structures are either bare or covered with a powdery coating, appearing blackish with smooth edges and a wavy shape. He recorded the spores as numbering 8 per spore sac, being oval-shaped, brown, divided by one cross-wall, and measuring 15–23 by 8–11 micrometres.\nAlthough the original French text attributes some descriptions to 'Th. Fr.' (Theodor Magnus Fries), Olivier is recognised as the authority for this species. The type specimen, H-ACH 1428, was later designated by Jack  Laundon in 1995, when he proposed the name for conservation.\nIn North America, the species is commonly known as the \"hooded rosette lichen\".",
    "Description": "Physcia adscendens has a thallus that ranges in colour from grey to greenish grey, with narrow hood-shaped lobes turned up at the ends. Long dark tipped cilia grow from under the hoods. Pseudocyphellae cover the upper surface. Soralia form at the edges of hoods to open out revealing soredia. Apothecia appear on short stalks with black pruinose discs. The spores measure 16–23 by 7–10 μm. Spot tests of the cortex are K+ (yellow); the medulla is unreactive (K–, C–, P–), a combination that indicates the presence of atranorin.",
    "Habitat, distribution, and ecology": "Physcia adscendens grows on both calcareous and siliceous rocks. It is common on limestone monuments, twigs and tree trunks. In a Spanish study of the post-fire colonisation success of various lichen species, Physcia adscendens was determined to have one of the greatest colonisation success rates due to its ability to colonise a variety of substrates. It was able to grow on all of the studied substrates, and comprised the largest biomass percentage in the study area. It is often found colonising granite, including churches and monuments.\nIn a 2011 study, Physcia adscendens thallus was fed to nine snail species that are common in temperate Europe. The lichen was able to regenerate from about 40% of the faecal pellets, suggesting that this could be another way that the lichen is dispersed. A 2025 survey of epiphytic lichens on 576 roadside trees in Amsterdam recorded 100 species; P. adscendens was among the very common epiphytes, occurring on more than 500 of the 576 surveyed trees alongside Xanthoria parietina. The authors placed P. adscendens at the core of a xerophytic–nitrophilous ecological group (corresponding to the Physcietum adscendentis association) that forms lush mosaics on many urban trunks, and often persists as one of the last lichens on severely desiccated bark where most other species have disappeared.\nLichenicolous (lichen-dwelling) fungus species that are known to use Physcia adscendens as a host include Lichenoconium lichenicolum and Phoma physciicola.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Platismatia glauca": {
    "Introduction": "Platismatia glauca is a common and widespread species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. This distinctive lichen forms pale to dull grey patches measuring 1–15 centimetres across, with wavy, irregularly indented lobes that often have reproductive structures (apothecia) along their upturned margins. The species is known for its adaptability to varying nitrogen levels in the environment and contains several unique secondary metabolites that have been subjects of scientific research. In 2024, scientists completed a high-quality genome sequence of P. glauca as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, providing valuable resources for future studies of this widely distributed lichen that can be found throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America.",
    "Taxonomy": "It was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum. William and Chicita Culberson transferred it to the genus Platismatia in 1968.\nA high-quality, chromosomally complete genome sequence has recently been assembled for Platismatia glauca as part of the Darwin Tree of Life Project, which aims to sequence all named eukaryotic species in Britain and Ireland. The genome, sequenced from a specimen collected at Benmore Botanic Garden in Scotland, spans 33.2 megabases and is scaffolded into 21 chromosomal pseudomolecules, with an additional complete mitochondrial genome. The assembly achieved high completeness and accuracy. While this represents a single haplotype, an alternate assembly was also deposited, reflecting the high heterozygosity of the sample. This genomic resource not only strengthens the taxonomic foundation of P. glauca but also supports future studies into its phenotypic variability, symbiotic complexity, and biochemical diversity.",
    "Description": "Platismatia glauca is a foliose lichen species that typically forms extensive patches measuring 1–6 cm in diameter, though specimens can occasionally reach up to 15 cm. The thallus (the main body of the lichen) is relatively thin, with lobes extending to 1.5 cm in width. These lobes are characterised by their wavy, irregularly indented appearance with ascending margins that may be entire (smooth-edged) or sub-lobulate (slightly lobed).\nThe margins often feature distinctive clusters of reproductive structures that can appear as simple to coralloid (coral-like), much-branched isidia (small vegetative propagules) or partially as granular soredia (powdery propagative structures). The upper surface of the lichen is typically pale to dull grey, frequently showing a brownish tinge—or becoming entirely brown in locations exposed to high light levels. This colouration remains unchanged when wet. The surface texture ranges from smooth to wrinkled or slightly ridged, and lacks pseudocyphellae (small pores in the upper cortex).\nThe lower surface is predominantly black, though it may appear brown or white in shaded conditions, especially towards the margins. This underside features varying numbers of scattered rhizine (root-like structures that attach the lichen to its substrate), which may be unbranched or branched.\nFruiting bodies (apothecia) are extremely rare in this species, measuring 5–9 mm in diameter when present, and typically occur along the margins. These apothecia have a reddish-brown disc with a thin thalline margin that tends to become less distinct as the apothecium matures. The ascospores (sexual spores) measure 3.5–8.5 by 3–5 μm. Chemical spot testing shows that the cortex is K+ (yellow) due to the presence of atranorin. The medulla (inner layer) is C−, potassium hydroxide K−, KC−, Pd−, and does not fluoresce under ultraviolet light (UV−). The main medullary substance is caperatic acid.",
    "Research": "Platismatia glauca can acclimate to large variations in the availability of environmental nitrogen. It efficiently assimilates increased nitrogen into its thallus, increasing the size as well as the photosynthetic capabilities of its photobiont.",
    "Chemistry": "Several secondary metabolites (lichen products) have been isolated from the species, including the nor-triterpene ketone, 30-nor-21α-hopan-22-one, the depsides atranorin and chloroatranorin, and the aromatic compounds methyl β-orcinolcarboxylate and chloroatranol. Other compounds in the lichen are salazinic acid, β-orcinol carboxylic acid, 3-hydroxyphysodalic acid, physodalic acid, and physodic acid.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Pleurotus ostreatus": {
    "Introduction": "Pleurotus ostreatus, commonly known the oyster mushroom, grey oyster mushroom, oyster fungus, hiratake, or pearl oyster mushroom, is a popular edible mushroom found in temperate and subtropical forests around the world.",
    "Name": "Both the Latin and common names refer to the shape of the fruiting body. The Latin pleurotus (side-ear) refers to the sideways growth of the stem with respect to the cap, while the Latin ostreatus (and the English common name, oyster) refers to the shape of the cap which resembles the bivalve of the same name. The oyster reference may also derive from the slippery texture of the mushroom.",
    "Description": "The cap is broad, fan or oyster-shaped, and 2–30 centimetres (1–12 inches) wide. In the wild, it ranges from white to gray or brown; the margin is inrolled when young, smooth and often somewhat lobed or wavy. The flesh is white, firm, and varies in thickness due to stipe arrangement. The stipe, if present, is up to 4 cm (1+1⁄2 in) long and thick, off-center and attaching laterally to wood. The gills are whitish, sometimes becoming yellowish, and decurrent if a stalk is present. The spore print is white to lilac-gray, and best viewed on a dark background. The mushroom has the bittersweet aroma of benzaldehyde or bitter almonds.",
    "Similar species": "It is related to the similarly cultivated Pleurotus eryngii (king oyster mushroom). Other similar species include P. columbinus, P. cornucopiae, Hohenbuehelia petaloides, the hairy-capped Phyllotopsis nidulans, and the smaller Pleurocybella porrigens.\nOmphalotus nidiformis is a toxic lookalike found in Australia. In North America, potential lookalikes include the toxic muscarine-containing O. olivascens (the western jack-o'-lantern mushroom) and Clitocybe dealbata (the ivory funnel mushroom). Some toxic Lentinellus species are similar in appearance, but have gills with jagged edges and finely haired caps.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "The oyster mushroom is widespread in many temperate and subtropical forests throughout the world, although it is absent from the Pacific Northwest of North America, being replaced by P. pulmonarius and P. populinus. It is a saprotroph that acts as a primary decomposer of wood, especially deciduous trees, and beech trees in particular. It is a white-rot wood-decay fungus.\nThe oyster mushroom can be found in many habitats, year round in the United Kingdom, while some related species (e.g. the branched oyster mushroom) grow only on trees.",
    "Ecology": "While this mushroom is often seen growing on dying hardwood trees, it only appears to be acting saprophytically, rather than parasitically. As the tree dies of other causes, P. ostreatus grows on the rapidly increasing mass of dead and dying wood. They actually benefit the forest by decomposing the dead wood, returning vital elements and minerals to the ecosystem in a form usable to other plants and organisms. Additionally, oyster mushrooms bioaccumulate lithium.\nPredatory behavior on nematodes has evolved independently in all major fungal lineages. P. ostreatus is one of at least 700 known nematophagous mushrooms.  Its mycelia can kill and digest nematodes, which is believed to be a way in which the mushroom obtains nitrogen.",
    "Uses": "Commercial cultivation of this mushroom first began in Germany as a subsistence measure during World War I, and it is now grown commercially around the world for food.",
    "Culinary": "The oyster mushroom is a choice edible. Oyster mushrooms are used in Czech, Polish, and Slovak contemporary cuisine in soups and stews in a similar fashion to meat, as well as breaded to become a vegetarian alternative to the kotlet in Polish dishes. It is a delicacy in Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia it is common to find street food vendors selling crispy deep fried oyster mushrooms. It is frequently served on its own, in soups, stuffed, or in stir-fry recipes with soy sauce. Oyster mushrooms may be used in sauces, such as vegetarian oyster sauce. The mushroom's taste has been described as mild with a slight odor similar to anise. It is best when picked young; as the mushroom ages, the flesh becomes tough and the flavor becomes acrid.",
    "Other uses": "The pearl oyster mushroom is also used to create mycelium bricks, mycelium furniture, and leather-like products. \nOyster mushrooms can also be used industrially for mycoremediation purposes. Oyster mushrooms were used to treat soil that had been polluted with diesel oil. The mushroom was able to convert 95% of the oil into non-toxic compounds. P. ostreatus is also capable of growing upon and degrading oxo-biodegradable plastic bags; it can also contribute to the degradation of renewable polyethylene.\nThe species has been found to contain the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin."

    "Cultivation": "Pleurotus pulmonarius is a commonly cultivated oyster mushroom species in Europe and North America. The most popular species for cultivation are the warm-weather varieties, sometimes mistakenly marketed by spawn manufacturers and cultivators under the name \"Pleurotus sajor-caju\" (Fr.) Singer, which is in fact a separate species, and was returned to the genus Lentinus by Pegler (1975), and is now called Lentinus sajor-caju (Fr.) Fries.\nPleurotus pulmonarius is commercially cultivated in New Zealand, sold as \"Oyster mushrooms\". The archetypal oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, cannot be imported into New Zealand due to perceived risks to its forestry industry.\nThe cultivation of Pleurotus pulmonarius is very similar to how one would cultivate other types of Pleurotus species, like P. ostreatus, by transferring mycelium from a petri plate onto grain and then transferring the resulting \"grain spawn\" after the mycelium colonizes it to substrates of straw, wood chips, sawdust, cardboard, coffee grounds, and other cellulose-based substrates.",
    "Medical research": "Several studies done on animals and in vitro suggest P. pulmonarius and its extracts may have medicinal applications for a wide range of conditions.\nA polysaccharide called β-D-Glucan from P. pulmonarius reduces sensitivity to pain in mice  and could be an \"attractive\" basis for new analgesic medications. In a different study on mice, a glucan from P. pulmonarius showed potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. A methanol extract of P. pulmonarius displayed anti-inflammatory and antitumor activity comparable to the standard reference drugs diclofenac and cisplatin, respectively.\nA 2010 study concluded that extracts of P. pulmonarius may slow the proliferation of cancer cells with high galectin-3 levels, while at the same time downregulate tumour cell adherence – which is directly related to the progression and spread of cancer. Extracts of P. pulmonarius added to the diet of mice delayed carcinogenesis, suggesting that these extracts may be useful as an adjuvant to cancer therapies.\nAn orally administered hot water extract of P. pulmonarius had a significant antihyperglycemic effect, halted the progression of diabetes, and reduced the mortality of alloxan induced diabetic mice by approximately 50%. It showed a synergistic effect with the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide, supporting the possibility of effective combination therapy of glibenclamide and P. pulmonarius for diabetes.\nPleurotus pulmonarius may be effective in the treatment of hay fever by inhibiting the release of histamine. Powdered P. pulmonarius mushrooms caused a significant reduction in sneezing and nasal rubbing when fed in water to sensitized mice, although the effect gradually builds up over a matter of weeks. When they were given 500 mg/kg a day, a significant effect was observed after two weeks, and it was four weeks before a significant change was observed at 200 mg/kg.\nExtracts of P. pulmonarius attenuated the development of acute colitis in a mouse model, suggesting a possible clinical use in the treatment of colitis. A further study by the same authors concluded that the extracts also inhibit colon cancer formation associated with colitis in mice.\nExtracts of P. pulmonarius have antimicrobial properties and exhibit antioxidant activity in vitro.",
    "Similar species": "Pleurotus ostreatus is very similar, as is North America's Pleurotus populinus, which is restricted to growing on aspen and cottonwood (genus Populus). It may resemble a Clitocybe, some of which are poisonous, when growing on the top of wood."

  "Psathyrella candolleana": {
    "Introduction": "Candolleomyces candolleanus (formerly known as Psathyrella candolleana), commonly known as the common brittlestem, is a species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. The color is tannish when young, fading to white. It is found in lawns in North America.",
    "Description": "The cap is tan when young, fading to whitish, and growing to 2–8 cm (1–3 in) in diameter; they are initially conical, later becoming rounded and finally with upturned margins in maturity. The cap margin is irregular and radially asymmetrical—a defining characteristic of this species. It can retain veil fragments on the edge and center. The white stalk is 4–10 cm (1.5–4 in) tall and 3–7 mm wide. The spore print is purple-brown, while spores are smooth and elliptical, measuring 6.5–8 by 4–5 μm.",
    "Similar species": "One similar species is Psathyrella gracilis. Some species may have darker caps when young, drying to match that of C. candolleanus. Also similar are C. tuberculatus, Britzelmayria multipedata, and members of Coprinopsis and Psathyrella.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet candolleanus honors Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle.",
    "Distribution": "It is commonly found growing in small groups around stumps and tree roots on lawns and pastures in North America and Europe. In 2014, it was reported from Iraq.",
    "Edibility": "While it is edible and may have a good flavor, it is not recommended due to its thin flesh, alleged poor culinary value and consistency, as well as difficulty in identification."

  "Pseudevernia furfuracea": {
    "Introduction": "Pseudevernia furfuracea, commonly known as tree moss, is a lichenized species of fungus that grows on the bark of firs and pines. The lichen is rather sensitive to air pollution, its presence usually indicating good air conditions in the growing place. The species has numerous human uses, including use in perfume, embalming and in medicine. Large amounts of tree moss is annually processed in France for the perfume industry.",
    "Description": "Pseudevernia furfuracea is associated with photobionts from the green algae genus Trebouxia. It reproduces asexually by isidia. The ontogeny of isidia development and its role in CO2 gas exchange in P. furfuracea has been investigated.\nThe preferred growing surfaces for P. furfuracea are the so-called \"nutrient poor\" bark trees, including birch, pine and spruce. While P. furfuracea reproduces mainly through isidia, some specimens rarely develop soralia. When present, the soralia are regularly capitate, substipitate, whitish, and occur on both laminal and marginal surfaces of the thalli.\nThe species has two morphologically identical varieties that are distinguished by the secondary metabolites they produce: var. ceratea Zopf. produces olivetoric acid and other physodic acids, while var. furfuracea produces physodic but not olivetoric acid. Some authors (e.g., Hale 1968) have separated the chemotypes at the species level, designating the olivetoric acid-containing specimens as Pseudevernia olivetorina, but more recent literature separates them at the varietal level.",
    "Perfumes": "Large amounts of tree moss (approximately 1900 tons in 1997) are processed in Grasse, France for the perfume industry.",
    "Embalming": "In ancient Egyptian embalming, P. furfuracea was found packed into the body cavity of mummies, although it is not certain whether this was done because of the supposed preservative properties or the aromatic properties of the lichen.",
    "Antimicrobial activity": "Soluble extracts from P. furfuracea var. furfuracea and var. ceratea, as well as specific compounds found therein, have antimicrobial activity against a variety of microorganisms.",
    "Medicinal use": "In Alfacar and Viznar, Andalucia (Spain), P. furfuracea is used for respiratory complaints. The thallus is washed and boiled for a long time to prepare a decoction that is drunk.\nWater extracts of this species have been shown to have a potent protective effect on genotoxicity caused by bismuth compounds such as colloidal bismuth subcitrate.",
    "Heavy metal sorption": "Pseudevernia furfuracea has been investigated for its ability to absorb heavy metals from solution. The metal-binding biosorption for copper(II) and nickel(II) was shown to follow the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, suggesting it may have potential as a biosorbent for treatment of heavy metal wastes.",
    "Pollution monitors": "Because specimens of P. furfuracea tend to bioaccumulate heavy metals like Cr, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Fe, Mn and Cu proportional to their concentration in airborne particulates, they may be used as a biomonitor of air quality, although it has been noted that both trace metal accumulation and major element accumulation is partly dependent on the hydration level of the specimen. Also, the species is sensitive to ozone concentrations: ozone fumigation results in biophysical, physiological, and structural impairment of specimens.\nP. furfuracea has also been used to monitor the levels of radionuclides such as Cesium-137 in Austria after the Chernobyl nuclear accident.",
    "Conservation status": "In Iceland, P. furfuracea is found in only two locations and is classified as critically endangered (CR).",
    "Bioactive compounds": "In addition to the physodic acid mentioned above, P. furfuracea also contains 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,6-dimethyl benzoic acid, atranorin, oxyphysodic acid, and virensic acid. Of these compounds, atranorin showed the highest inhibition of proteolytic enzymes trypsin and porcine pancreatic elastase. Research suggests that the biosynthesis of both atranorin and physodic acid is influenced by the cooperation of epiphytic bacteria.\nA number of sterol compounds have been identified from P. furfuracea, including ergosterol peroxide, ergosterol and lichosterol.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Psilocybe azurescens": {
    "Introduction": "Psilocybe azurescens—commonly known as the flying saucer mushroom, blue angel mushroom, or azure psilocybin mushroom—is a species of psychedelic mushroom whose main active compounds are psilocybin and psilocin. It is among the most potent of the tryptamine-bearing mushrooms, containing up to 1.8% psilocybin, 0.5% psilocin, and 0.4% baeocystin by dry weight, averaging to about 1.1% psilocybin and 0.15% psilocin. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae in the order Agaricales.",
    "Description": "The cap (pileus) of Psilocybe azurescens is 3–10 cm (1.2–3.9 in) in diameter. It has a  conic to convex shape, expanding to broadly convex and eventually flattening with age with a pronounced, persistent broad umbo. Its  surface is smooth and viscous when moist, covered by a separable gelatinous pellicle. It is chestnut to ochraceous brown to caramel in color, often becoming pitted with dark blue or bluish black zones. It is  hygrophanous, fading to light straw color in drying and  strongly bruising blue when damaged. Its margin is even, sometimes irregular and eroded at maturity.  At first, it is slightly incurved, though it becomes decurved with time. The cap is translucent striate and often leaves a fibrillose annular zone in the upper regions of the stipe\nThe lamellae are ascending, and have a sinuate to adnate attachment. They are brown and stain black when injured. They are close, and two-tiered, with whitish edges. The spore print is a dark purplish brown to purplish black.\nThe stipe is 9–20 cm (3.5–7.9 in) in length and 3–6 mm (0.1–0.2 in). It is  thick, silky white to dingy brown with age. It is hollow at maturity, and composed of twisted, cartilaginous tissue. The base of the stipe thickens downwards, is often curved, and is characterized by coarse white aerial tufts of mycelium, often with azure tones. The mycelium surrounding the stipe base is densely rhizomorphic (i.e., root-like), silky white, tenaciously holding the wood-chips together.\nThe taste of this mushroom is extremely bitter, while it is odorless to starchy smelling.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "P. azurescens occurs naturally along a small area of the West Coast of the United States, including in parts of Oregon and California. It has been regularly found as far south as Depoe Bay, Oregon, and as far north as Grays Harbor County, Washington. Its primary locations are clustered around the Columbia River Delta: the first type collections were made in Hammond, Oregon, near Astoria. It is also quite prevalent north of the Columbia River in Washington, from Long Beach north to Westport. Some feral specimens have also been reported in Stuttgart, Germany. While infrequent, the mushroom can sometimes be found around decaying wood in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, which decriminalized psilocybin in 2020. Ilwaco, Washington also has a large population, but harvesting is a potential misdemeanor that is enforced by local law enforcement agencies.\nThe species' preferred environment ranges from caespitose (growing in tight, separated clusters) to gregarious on deciduous wood-chips and/or in sandy soils rich in lignicolous (woody) debris. The mushroom has an affinity for coastal dune grasses. In aspect it generates an extensive, dense, and tenacious mycelial mat (collyboid). P. azurescens causes the whitening of wood. Fruitings begin in late September and continue until \"late December and early January\", according to mycologist Paul Stamets. Psilocybe azurescens has been cultivated in many countries including Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and its native United States (especially in California, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania).",
    "Legal status": "Possession and/or cultivation of this species is illegal in a number of countries, including in the United States under federal law. However, in the state of Colorado, as well as through the work of Decriminalize Nature in cities such as of Seattle, Washington; Oakland, California; Santa Cruz, California; and Ann Arbor, Michigan policy to effectively decriminalize possession, cultivation, and sharing of personal amounts of psilocybin mushrooms has passed successfully. It is considered a Class A Drug in New Zealand.",
    "Effects": "Wood lover's paralysis, a form of temporary paralysis or weakness, has been reported anecdotally after the ingestion of P. azurescens mushrooms.  Baeocystin is present in fruiting bodies, with trace amounts of norbaeocystin. Psilocybin concentration decreases with age."

  "Psilocybe cubensis": {
    "Introduction": "Psilocybe cubensis, commonly known as the magic mushroom, shroom, golden halo,  cube, or gold cap, is a species of psilocybin mushroom of moderate potency whose principal active compounds are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the fungus family Hymenogastraceae and was previously known as Stropharia cubensis.  It is the best-known psilocybin mushroom due to its wide distribution and ease of cultivation.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described in 1906 as Stropharia cubensis by American mycologist Franklin Sumner Earle in Cuba. In 1907, it was identified as Naematoloma caerulescens in Tonkin (now Vietnam) by  French pharmacist and mycologist Narcisse Théophile Patouillard, while in 1941, it was called Stropharia cyanescens by William Alphonso Murrill near Gainesville in Florida. German-born mycologist Rolf Singer moved the species into the genus Psilocybe in 1949, giving it the binomial name Psilocybe cubensis. The synonyms were later also assigned to the species Psilocybe cubensis.\nThe name  Psilocybe  is derived from the Ancient Greek roots psilos (ψιλος) and kubê (κυβη), and translates as \"bare head\". Cubensis means \"coming from Cuba\", and refers to the type locality published by Earle.\nSinger divided P. cubensis into three varieties: the nominate, which usually had a brownish cap, Murrill's cyanescens from Florida, which generally had a pale cap, and var caerulascens from Indochina with a more yellowish cap.\nPsilocybe cubensis is commonly known as gold top, golden top or gold cap in Australia, sacred mushroom or blue mushroom in Brazil, and San Ysidro or Palenque mushroom in the United States and Mexico, while the term \"magic mushroom\" has been applied to hallucinogenic mushrooms in general. It is commonly known as \"Golden teacher\" in South Africa. A common name in Thai is \"Hed keequai\", which translates as \"mushroom which appears after water buffalo defecates\".\nBetween 2013 and 2022, several samples of an unknown species of Psilocybe mushroom were collected. These samples bore similar superficial characteristics to P. cubensis, as well as similar habit and habitat. Microscopic and genetic testing of these samples led to the conclusion that they were closely related but different species, estimated to have shared a common ancestor some time in the last 3 million years. The new species bears the provisional name Psilocybe ochraceocentrata.",
    "Description": "The cap is 1.6–8 cm (3⁄4–3+1⁄4 in), conic to convex with a central papilla when young, becoming broadly convex to plane with age, retaining a slight umbo sometimes surrounded by a ring-shaped depression. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, sometimes with white universal veil remnants attached. The cap is brown becoming paler to almost white at the margin and fades to more golden-brown or yellowish with age. When bruised, all parts of the mushroom stain blue. The narrow grey gills are adnate to adnexed, sometimes seceding attachment, and darken to purplish-black and somewhat mottled with age. The gill edges remain whitish. The hollow white stipe is 4–15 cm (2–6 in) high by 0.4–1.4 cm (1⁄4–1⁄2 in) thick, becoming yellowish in age. The well-developed veil leaves a persistent white membranous ring whose surface usually becomes the same color as the gills because of falling spores. The fruiting bodies are 90% water. The mushroom has no odor and has been described as tasting farinaceous, with an alkaline or metallic aftertaste. The spores are 11.5–17.3 x 8–11.5 μm, sub-ellipsoid, basidia 4-spored but sometimes 2- or 3-, pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia present.",
    "Similar species": "The related species Psilocybe subcubensis—found in tropical regions—is indistinguishable but has smaller spores. Panaeolus semiovatus can appear similar but does not stain.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Psilocybe cubensis is a pan-tropical species, occurring in the Gulf Coast states and southeastern United States, Mexico, in the Central American countries of Belize, Costa Rica, Panamá, El Salvador and Guatemala, the Caribbean countries Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guadalupe, Martinique, and Trinidad,  in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, Uruguay and Peru, Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, India, Australia, Fiji, and possibly Nepal and Hawaii.\nPsilocybe cubensis is found on cow (and occasionally horse) dung, sugar cane mulch or rich pasture soil, with mushrooms appearing from February to December in the northern hemisphere, and November to April in the southern hemisphere. In Asia, the species grows on water buffalo dung. Along with other fungi that grow on cow dung, P. cubensis is thought to have colonized Australia with the introduction of cattle there, 1800 of which were on the Australian mainland by 1803—having been transported there from the Cape of Good Hope, Kolkata and the American west coast. In Australia, the species grows between northern Queensland to southern New South Wales.\nIn March 2018, several Psilocybe cubensis specimens were collected in Zimbabwe in the Wedza District of Mashonaland East province, approx. 120 km  southeast of Harare. This was the first reported occurrence of a psilocybin mushroom in Zimbabwe. The mushrooms were collected on Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservation—a nature reserve that is home to both wildlife and cattle, as well as cattle egrets.",
    "Relationship with cattle": "Because Psilocybe cubensis is intimately associated with cattle ranching, the fungus has found unique dispersal niches not available to most other members of the family Hymenogastraceae. Of particular interest is the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), a colonizer of Old World origin (via South America), whose range of distribution overlaps much of that of Psilocybe cubensis. Cattle egrets typically walk alongside cattle, preying on insects; they track through spore-laden vegetation and cow dung and transfer the spores to suitable habitats, often thousands of miles away during migration activities. This type of spore dispersal is known as zoochory, and it enables a parent species to propagate over a much greater range than it could achieve alone. The relationship between cattle, cattle egrets, and Psilocybe cubensis is an example of symbiosis—a situation in which dissimilar organisms live together in close association.",
    "Cultivation": "Psilocybe cubensis grows naturally in tropical and subtropical conditions, often near cattle due to the ideal conditions they provide for the growth of the fungus. The cow usually consumes grains or grass covered with the spores of P. cubensis and the fungus will begin to germinate within the dung.\nMushrooms such as Psilocybe cubensis are relatively easy to cultivate indoors. First, spores are inoculated within sterilized jars or bags, colloquially known as grainspawn, containing a form of carbohydrate nutrient such as rye grains. After approximately one month, the spores fully colonize the grain spawn forming dense mycelium, which is then planted within a bulk substrate such as a coconut husk fiber and vermiculite mixture. Given proper humidity, temperature, and fresh air exchange, the substrate will produce fruiting Psilocybe cubensis bodies within a month of planting. To preserve potency after harvesting, growers often dehydrate the fruit and store them in air-tight containers in cool environments.\nA study conducted in 2009 showed that mushrooms grown in the dark had higher levels of psilocybin and psilocin compared to the mushrooms grown in bright, indirect light, which had minimum levels.\nStudies were conducted where an environmentally controlled wind tunnel and a computer program were used to determine the influence of humidity on the individual basidiocarps of P. cubensis which aided in mapping their growth and development. The transpiration and growth of the mushroom were heavily influenced by the humidity of the air, and the transpiration was accelerated at higher humidities while light did not affect the growth. Faster growth was observed at higher humidities. It was also discovered that misting enhanced both the growth and transpiration rates in the growing process of P. cubensis.\n\nSmall-scale cultivation of P. cubensis is often accomplished with \"cakes\" that colonize within jars, but fruit inside specially designed tubs called \"shotgun fruiting chambers\". The most common cake method for beginners is PF-Tek (\"Psilocybe Fanaticus technique\"), named after Psylocybe Fanaticus, the clandestine cultivator credited for its creation. Cakes are popular for the new cultivator because of their simplicity and low cost of startup materials. As cakes are composed of brown rice flour, vermiculite, and gypsum, they can be steam-sterilized in a large pot. Unlike cereal grains used in bulk growing, brown rice flour contains no bacterial endospores, a contamination vector requiring a pressure cooker to sterilize.\nThe \"Uncle Ben's Tek\", also known as Spiderman Tek and Instant Rice Tek, is a growing method using microwavable rice sachets. This technique involves utilizing pre-sterilized rice bags for mycelium to colonize upon. Though Uncle Ben's Tek is largely popular among beginners due to its low cost, it faces criticism from those more experienced due to its high rate of contamination compared to other techniques. \nOther Teks exist, such as Lemon-Tek and Bucket-Tek, though all Tek's do not refer to methods for growth. Rather, they refer to knowledge regarding the cultivation, harvest, processing, and consumption for psychedelic fungi. TEK stands for Traditional Ecological Knowledge, though others claim it stands for Time Experience Knowledge or is simply a shortening of the term 'technique'.\nCultivation methods resulting in larger yields are categorized as \"bulk growing\". Bulk growing allows cultivators to operate on a larger scale, but require a greater investment of time, money, and knowledge. While small-scale grows utilize spore syringes to inject spore solution into cakes, bulk methods instead use grain spawn as primary nutrition for the subsequent growth. Additionally, cultivators must develop solid sterile technique in working with agar. Instead of inoculating grain with spores, growers instead germinate spores on agar plates, then transfer the resultant healthy mycelium to the grain jars. Once the grain is colonized with clean mycelial growth, users inoculate their bulk substrates with the grain in a process known as \"spawning.\" Bulk substrates are frequently a mix of coir, vermiculite and gypsum due to not requiring pasteurization or sterilization. However, some utilize blends of manure-based substrates or straw; substrates which always require pasteurization with open-air spawning. After spawning, the healthy mycelium will colonize the bulk substrate, and given proper conditions, eventually fruit mushrooms.\nTerence and Dennis McKenna made P. cubensis particularly famous when they published Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide in the 1970s upon their return from the Amazon rainforest, having deduced new methods (based on pre-existing techniques originally described by J.P. San Antonio) for growing psilocybin mushrooms and assuring their audience that P. cubensis were amongst the easiest psilocybin-containing mushrooms to cultivate.\nThe potency of cultivated specimens can vary widely per each flush (harvest). In a classic paper published by Jeremy Bigwood and M.W. Beug, it was shown that with each flush, psilocybin levels varied somewhat unpredictably but were much the same on the first flush as they were on the last flush; however, psilocin was typically absent in the first two flushes but peaked by the fourth flush, making it the most potent. Two strains were also analyzed to determine potency in caps and stems: In one strain the caps contained generally twice as much psilocybin as the stems, but the small amount of psilocin present was entirely in the stems. In the other strain, a trace of psilocin was present in the cap but not in the stem; the cap and stem contained equal amounts of psilocybin. The study concluded that the levels of psilocybin and psilocin vary by over a factor of four in cultures of P. cubensis grown under controlled conditions.",
    "Psychedelic and entheogenic use": "Singer noted in 1949 that Psilocybe cubensis had psychoactive properties.\nIn Australia, the use of psychoactive mushrooms grew rapidly between 1969 and 1975.\nIn a 1992 paper, locals and tourists in Thailand were reported to consume P. cubensis and related species in mushroom omelets—particularly in Ko Samui and Ko Pha-ngan. At times, omelets were adulterated with LSD, resulting in prolonged intoxication. A thriving subculture had developed in the region. Other localities, such as Hat Yai, Ko Samet, and Chiang Mai, also had some reported usage.\nIn 1996, jars of honey containing Psilocybe cubensis were confiscated at the Dutch-German border. Upon examination, it was revealed that jars of honey containing psychedelic mushrooms were being sold at Dutch coffee shops.\nP. cubensis is one of the most widely known of the psilocybin-containing mushrooms used for triggering psychedelic experiences after ingestion.\nIts major alkaloids are:\n\nPsilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine)\nPsilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine)\nBaeocystin (4-phosphoryloxy-N-methyltryptamine)\nNorbaeocystin (4-phosphoryloxytryptamine)\nAeruginascin (N,N,N-trimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine)\nThe potential psychoactivity of other compounds other than psilocybin and psilocin has been speculated but not confirmed.\nThe concentrations of psilocin and psilocybin, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, are in the range of 0.14–0.42% (wet weight) and 0.37–1.30% (dry weight) in the whole mushroom 0.17–0.78% (wet weight) and 0.44–1.35% (dry weight) in the cap, and 0.09%–0.30% (wet weight) and 0.05–1.27% (dry weight) in the stem, respectively. For quickly and practically measuring the psychoactive contents of most healthy Psilocybe cubensis varieties, it can generally be assumed that there is approximately 15 mg (+/- 5 mg) of psilocybin per gram of dried mushroom. Furthermore, due to factors such as age and storage method, the psilocybin and psilocin content of a given sample of mushrooms will vary.\nIndividual body composition, brain chemistry and psychological predisposition play a significant role in determining appropriate doses. For a modest psychedelic effect, a minimum of one gram of dried Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms is ingested orally, 0.25–1 gram is usually sufficient to produce a mild effect, 1–2.5 grams usually provides a moderate effect and 2.5 grams and higher usually produces strong effects. For most people, 3.5 dried grams (1/8 oz) would be considered a high dose and may produce an intense experience; this is, however, typically considered a standard dose among recreational users. Body composition (usually weight) should be taken into account when calculating dosage. For many individuals, doses above three grams may be overwhelming. For a few rare people, doses as small as 0.25 gram can produce full-blown effects normally associated with very high doses. For most people, however, that dose level would have virtually no effects.\nThere are many different ways to ingest Psilocybe cubensis. Users may prefer to take them raw, freshly harvested, or dried and preserved. It is also possible to prepare culinary dishes such as pasta or tea with the mushrooms. However, the psychoactive compounds begin to break down rapidly at temperatures exceeding 100 °C (212 °F). Another method of ingestion known as \"Lemon Tekking\" involves combining pulverized Psilocybe cubensis with a concentrated citrus juice with a pH of ~2. Many users believe that a considerable amount of the psilocybin will have been dephosphorylated into psilocin, the psychoactive metabolite, by citric acid. However, this claim is not substantiated by the literature on the metabolism of psilocybin, as dephosphorylation is known to be mediated by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase in humans. It is therefore more likely that citric acid mostly helps in breakdown of mushroom cells, aiding in digestion and  psilocybin release.\nThe \"Lemon Tekk\" method of consumption results in a more rapid onset and can offer easier digestion or reduced \"come-up pressure\" associated with raw consumption.\nUpon ingestion, effects usually begin after approximately 20–60 minutes (depending on the method of ingestion and stomach contents) and may last from four to ten hours, depending on dosage, potency of cultivar, and individual biochemistry. Visual distortions often occur, including walls that seem to breathe, a vivid enhancement of colors, and the animation of organic shapes.\nThe effects of high doses can be overwhelming depending on the particular phenotype of cubensis, grow method, and the individual. It is recommended not to eat wild mushrooms without properly identifying them as they may be poisonous. In particular, similar species include mushrooms of the genus Galerina and Pholiotina rugosa—all potentially deadly—and Chlorophyllum molybdites. All of these grow in pastures, a similar habitat to that preferred by P. cubensis.\n\nIn 2019, a 15-year-old boy suffered from transient kidney failure after eating P. cubensis from a cultivation kit in Canada. No one else in the group suffered any ill effects.",
    "Legality": "Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  However, mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin are not illegal in some parts of the world.  For example, in Brazil they are legal, but extractions from the mushroom containing psilocybin and psilocin remain illegal. In the United States, growing or possessing Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms is illegal in all states, but it is legal to possess and buy the spores for microscopy purposes. However, Denver, Colorado,  decriminalized them for those 21 and up on May 8, 2019. Oakland, California, followed suit, decriminalizing psilocybin-containing mushrooms as well as the peyote cactus on June 4, 2019. Santa Cruz, California, decriminalized naturally occurring psychedelics, including psilocybin mushrooms, on January 29, 2020. On November 3, 2020, the state of Oregon decriminalized possession of psilocybin mushrooms for recreational use and granted licensed practitioners permission to administer psilocybin mushrooms to individuals age 21 years and older.\nIn 1978, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in Fiske vs Florida that possession of psilocybin mushrooms is not illegal, in that the mushrooms cannot be considered a \"container\" for psilocybin based on how the law is written, i.e., it does not specifically state that psilocybin mushrooms themselves are illegal, but that the hallucinogenic constituents in them are. According to this decision, the applicable statute as framed imparts no information as to which plants may contain psilocybin in its natural state and does not advise a person of ordinary intelligence that this substance is contained in a particular variety of mushroom. The statute, therefore, cannot constitutionally be applied to the appellant.\nThe production, sale and possession of magic mushrooms is illegal in Canada."

  "Psilocybe cyanescens": {
    "Introduction": "Psilocybe cyanescens, commonly known as the wavy cap or potent psilocybe, is a species of potent psychedelic mushroom. The main compounds responsible for its psychedelic effects are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae. A formal description of the species was published by Elsie Wakefield in 1946 in the Transactions of the British Mycological Society, based on a specimen she had recently collected at Kew Gardens. She had begun collecting the species as early as 1910.  The mushroom is not generally regarded as being physically dangerous to adults. \nPsilocybe cyanescens can sometimes fruit in colossal quantities; more than 100,000 individual mushrooms were found growing in a single patch at a racetrack in England.",
    "Description": "Psilocybe cyanescens has a hygrophanous pileus (cap) that is caramel to chestnut-brown when moist, fading to pale buff or slightly yellowish when dried. Caps generally measure from 1.5–5 cm (1⁄2–2 in) across, and are normally distinctly wavy in maturity.  The color of the pileus is rarely seen in mushrooms outside of the P. cyanescens species complex. Most parts of the mushroom, including the cap and Lamellae (gills, underneath the cap) can stain blue when touched or otherwise disturbed, probably due to the oxidation of psilocin. The lamellae are adnate, and light brown to dark purple brown in maturity, with lighter gill edges. There is no distinct annulus, but immature P. cyanescens specimens do have a cobwebby veil which may leave an annular zone in maturity. Both the odor and taste are farinaceous.\nP. cyanescens has elliptical spores which measure 9–12 x 5–8 μm. According to some authors, the holotype collection of the species from Kew Gardens featured no pleurocystidia, but North American collections are characterized by common clavate-mucronate pleurocystidia. However, pleurocystidia are present in the holotype collection (but not easily to observe since hymenium is collapsed). In European collections of P. cyanescens, pleurocystidia are common and their shape is identical to those known from the United States. In 2012, an epitype from Hamburg, Germany was designated.\nFresh sporocarps and mycelia of P. cyanescens generally bruise blueish or blue-green where damaged, and the staining remains visible after drying. This staining is most noticeable on the stem (which is white when undisturbed) but can also occur on other parts of the mushroom, including the gills, cap, and mycelium.  This staining is due primarily to the oxidation of psilocin. (Psilocybin cannot be oxidized directly, but is quickly converted via enzymatic action to psilocin at injury sites which can then be oxidized, so even specimens with little psilocin still generally stain blue.)",
    "Related species": "Other related species may include P. weraroa, and these relatives are collectively referred to as the \"Psilocybe cyanescens complex\" or as the \"caramel-capped psilocybe complex,\" due to their extremely similar appearance and habit.  There is phylogenetic evidence that there are two distinct clades in the complex, one consisting of P. cyanescens and P. azurescens and allies, and the other consisting of P. serbica and allies (European taxa). It has also been shown that Psilocybe weraroa (previously known as Weraroa novae-zelandiae) is very closely related to P. cyanescens despite its vastly dissimilar appearance.\nA very close relative of P. cyanescens is Psilocybe allenii (described in 2012), formerly known informally as Psilocybe \"cyanofriscosa\" (nom. inval.), a mushroom found in California and Washington It can be distinguished by macromorphological features and/or sequencing of rDNA ITS molecular marker.\nIt is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between members of the P. cyanescens complex except by range without resorting to microscopic or molecular characters.\nAlthough not closely related, P. cyanescens has been at least occasionally confused with Galerina marginata with fatal results. The two mushrooms have generally similar habits and appearances, and bear a superficial resemblance to each other such that inexperienced mushroom-seekers may confuse the two. The two species can grow side-by-side, which may add to the chance of confusion.  The two mushrooms have different colored spores, making a spore print essential to proper identification.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Psilocybe cyanescens grows today primarily on wood chips, especially in and along the perimeter of mulched plant beds in urban areas, but can also grow on other lignin-rich substrates. P. cyanescens does not grow on substrate that is not lignin-rich. Fruitings have been reported in natural settings previously (although most appear to be migrations from mulched plant beds.)  The species does not typically grow on mulch that is made from bark.\nIn the United States, P. cyanescens occurs mainly in the Pacific Northwest, stretching south to the San Francisco Bay Area. It can also be found in areas such as New Zealand, Western Europe, Central Europe, and parts of west Asia (Iran). The range in which P. cyanescens occurs is rapidly expanding, especially in areas where it is not native as the use of mulch to control weeds has been popularized.  This rapid expansion of range may be due in part to the simple expedient of P. cyanescens mycelium having colonized the distribution network of woodchip suppliers and thus being distributed on a large scale with commercial mulch. It has been documented to fruit in Spring on the East Coast of the United States.\nAlthough it has been speculated that P. cyanescens' native habitat is the coniferous woodlands of the north-western United States or coastal dunes in the PNW, and the type specimen was described from mulch beds in Kew Gardens, the natural distribution of P. cyanescens in the wild remains unknown.\nFruiting is dependent on a drop in temperature. In the San Francisco Bay Area, this means that fruiting typically occurs between late October and February, and fruiting in other areas generally occurs in fall, when temperatures are between 10–18 °C (50–64 °F).\nPsilocybe cyanescens often fruits gregariously or in cespitose clusters, sometimes in great numbers. 100,000 P. cyanescens fruits were once found growing on a racetrack in the south of England. Solitary fruits are sometimes also found.",
    "Indole content": "The fruits of P. cyanescens have been shown to contain many different indole alkaloids including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. It has also been shown that P. cyanescens mycelium will contain detectable levels of psilocin and psilocybin, but only after the formation of primordia.\nIndole content has been shown to be higher in North American specimens of P. cyanescens than in European ones.  This was, however, caused by the fact that Gartz did not analyze the genuine P. cyanescens but P. serbica.\nNorth American fruiting bodies of P. cyanescens have been shown to have between 0.66% and 1.96% total indole content by dry weight.  European fruiting bodies have been shown to have between 0.39% and 0.75% total indole content by dry weight.\nNorth American specimens of P. cyanescens are among the most potent of psychedelic mushrooms.  Its potency means that it is widely sought after by users of recreational drugs in those areas where it grows naturally.",
    "Cultivation": "Fruiting begins with simulation of a fall environment at temperatures between 10–18 °C (50–64 °F).\nPsilocybe cyanescens, like many other psilocybin containing mushrooms, is sometimes cultivated. Due to the fruiting requirements of the species, it is challenging but possible to get P. cyanescens to produce fruits indoors. Outdoor cultivation in an appropriate climate is relatively easy. Yield per pound of substrate is low when compared to other psilocybin containing mushrooms for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.  The combination of poor yield and difficulty may explain why P. cyanescens is grown less frequently than some other psilocybin containing mushrooms.\nPsilocybe cyanescens mycelium is easier to grow than actual fruits are, can be grown indoors, and is robust enough that it can be transplanted in order to start new patches. Mycelium can also be propagated via stem butt transplantation. Many of the cultivation techniques used with other members of the genus Psilocybe can be used to grow P. cyanescens as well. Cultivated P. cyanescens contain approximately the same concentration of psilocin and psilocybin as natural examples do.",
    "Legal status": "Psilocybe cyanescens specimens do not fall under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances because the convention does not cover naturally occurring plants or fungi that incidentally contain a scheduled drug.  However, many countries choose to prohibit possession of psilocybin containing mushrooms, including P. cyanescens, under their domestic laws.\nCountries that have banned or severely regulated the possession of P. cyanescens include the United States, Germany, New Zealand, and many others. Although this is difficult to enforce since no species of Psilocybe mushroom has spores containing psilocybin or psilocin. Because of this, P. cyanescens spores are not illegal to possess in many US states.  (It is illegal to possess spores in Georgia and Idaho, and illegal to possess them with the intent to produce mushrooms in California.)"

  "Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata": {
    "Introduction": "Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata, commonly known as ovoid, psychedelic ovoid mushroom, or river teacher is a psilocybin mushroom native to North America. It is closely related to P. subaeruginascens from Java, P. septentrionalis from Japan, and P. wayanadensis from India.  This mushroom was first documented by Richard V. Gaines in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in June 2003.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet refers to the abundant ovoid pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia of this species.",
    "Description": "Cap: (1) 1.5 — 5 (8) cm across, convex to subumbonate, chestnut or orangish brown to yellowish brown to pearly cream color, hygrophanous, glabrous, sub-viscid, translucent-striate near the margin, from slightly to highly undulated in maturity. During youth, the cap is usually highly convex and dark brown/black (the stem is white). During maturity, the entire mushroom becomes light-brown (cinnamon-brown when moist and light-beige when dry). Mature specimens often naturally exhibit blue-greenish bruising, and old, dried-out specimens are usually all black. Appearance may vary significantly  among individuals, depending on maturity and location. Flesh thick, pliant. Bruises blue and green where injured.\nGills: adnate attachment and range from whitish to rusty brown, lavender, or dark purple brown.\nSpore print: Dark purple brown.\nStipe: (1.5) 3 – 9 (13) cm long by (2) 3 – 15 (20) mm wide, equal, somewhat subbulbous, hollow, base sometimes hypogeous, smooth at the top and often having small hairs near the bottom, colored whitish with irregular yellowish, brownish, or bluish tones. The partial veil is variable, ranging from a thin cortina that leaves a barely perceptible annular zone, to a substantial membrane that leaves a fairly persistent annulus. If a veil remnant is present, it is often found near the middle of the stem (unlike many other Psilocybe species, where it is just under the cap).\nTaste: farinaceous\nOdor: farinaceous to spicy\nMicroscopic features: Spores (7–) 8–9 (–12) × ( 5.5 – ) 6 – 7 (–8.5) μm, rhomboid to subrhomboid in face view, subellipsoid in side view, thick-walled, with the wall 0.8 to 1.5 μm thick.  One end of the spore has a broad germ pore and the other side has a short hilar appendage.  Two types of cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia are present.  One type of pleurocystidia measures 16 - 24 x 6 - 8 and is venstricose-rostrate.  The other type is larger, 20 - 40 micrometers by 12 - 16 micrometers, globose-pyriform, sometimes with a narrow apex and narrow base.  The basidia are 4 spored and measure 20 – 28 × 7 – 9 μm.",
    "Similar species": "Although P. ovoideocystidiata is sometimes confused with Psilocybe caerulipes, it can be distinguished by its rhomboid spores, larger stature, earlier fruiting season, and membranous annulus. The recently described Psilocybe caeruleorhiza differs  from P. ovoideocystidiata in lacking an annulus and fruiting in the late Fall and early Winter, rather than in the Spring and early Summer. Both of these Psilocybe species are known only from eastern North America. Other similar Psilocybe species could be confused with P. ovoideocystidiata in its western North American range. It can also be mistaken for species belonging to other brown-spored agaric genera such as Agrocybe, but these will lack the blue bruising reaction characteristic of psilocybin mushrooms.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata  is mainly native to the Eastern United States, where its range  stretches from Missouri east to Rhode Island and from Georgia north to Michigan. It is particularly common in the Ohio River valley. It also occurs in Western North America from Southern California north to British Columbia, Canada. As a relatively recently identified species, P. ovoideocystidiata is frequently reported to appear in new areas, leading some to speculate that its range is currently undergoing expansion.\nThis species grows on woody debris and can be found along rivers and streams, usually in  overflow areas, and in man-made mulch and wood chips in urban and suburban environments.  It is sometimes found alongside Japanese knotweed and also tends to prefer shady areas and avoid direct sunlight. It is typically gregarious, growing in groups of several hundred individuals in one particular area, as well as in multiple small clusters of several mushrooms each, within close proximity of one another. Solitary specimens also occur on occasion.\nSeasonality varies a great deal depending on what region they are found in, but in the northeastern US, they are most common in the spring, from mid-April to late-June (peaking late-May), especially after periods of steady heavy rain for several consecutive days (a common weather pattern in the eastern US during spring). However, they may occasionally fruit, as late as November.  These mushrooms seem to be very sensitive to the season and fruit chiefly in the spring; very little fruiting occurs during other times of the year, even during favorable weather conditions."

  "Psilocybe pelliculosa": {
    "Introduction": "Psilocybe pelliculosa is a species of fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae. The fruit bodies, or mushrooms, have a conical brownish cap up to 2 cm (3⁄4 in) in diameter atop a slender stem up to 8 cm (3+1⁄8 in) long. It has a white partial veil that does not leave a ring on the stem. American mycologist Alexander H. Smith first described the species in 1937 as a member of the genus known today as Psathyrella; it was transferred to Psilocybe by Rolf Singer in 1958.\nPsilocybe pelliculosa is found in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or clusters along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland, and also in Norway. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P. pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences in the form of the fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described scientifically by Alexander H. Smith in 1937 as Psathyra pelliculosa, based on specimens he collected in Washington and Oregon. The type specimen was collected near Tahkenitch Lake, Oregon, in November  1935. In a 1941 publication, Smith revised his opinion, and considered the species to be the same as Hypholoma silvatica (later Psilocybe silvatica), as he thought that the slight differences between the two were of no taxonomic significance. After reevaluating these two species in addition to several others closely related, Rolf Singer and Smith later reestablished the taxon and transferred it to Psilocybe in 1958. Psilocybe authority Gastón Guzmán classified the species in the section Semilanceatae, a grouping of related species characterized by having roughly ellipsoid, usually thick-walled spores, and lacking pleurocystidia.\nThe specific epithet pelliculosa is derived from the Latin pellicula, meaning \"film\", and refers to the gelatinous pellicle of the cap. The mushroom is commonly known as the \"conifer Psilocybe\" or the \"striate Psilocybe\".",
    "Description": "The cap of P. pelliculosa is initially sharply cone-shaped, and expands slightly over time to become broadly bell-shaped, but it never expands to become completely flat. The cap margin is pressed against the stem initially, and for a short time is appendiculate (has partial veil fragments hanging from the margin). The caps of mature specimens are smooth, sticky, and have translucent radial striations that reach dimensions of 0.8 to 2 cm (3⁄8 to 3⁄4 in) in diameter. The color ranges from umber to isabella (dark dingy yellow-brown) when the mushroom is moist, and changes to pinkish-buff when dry. The cap margin can have a greenish-gray tinge. The cap cuticle is a thin gelatinous covering that can be peeled off.\nThe gills have an adnate attachment to the cap, are narrow to moderately broad, closely spaced, and eventually separate from the stem. Young gills are cinnamon-brown in color, with lighter edges, but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores. The stem is 6 to 8 cm (2+3⁄8 to 3+1⁄8 in) long by 1.5 to 2 mm (1⁄16 to 3⁄32 in) thick, and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base; rather pliant but rigid. The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky fibrils pressed against the stem; the upper region is grayish and pruinose (lightly dusted with powdery white granules). The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish where it has been injured. The application of a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish to reddish brown; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change.\nThe spore print is purplish brown. Under the microscope, the spores appear dull purple-brown. They are ellipsoid to somewhat egg-shaped, and, according to Singer's original description, measure 8–10 by 4–5 μm. A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10–13 by 6–7 μm. The spores have an apical germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 22–35 by 7–10 μm. There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band on the edges of the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends) with a sharp tip, and measure 25–30 by 6–9 μm. The cap cuticle (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline hyphae that are 0.8–5.5 μm in diameter.",
    "Similar species": "The overall stature of the fruit bodies of P. pelliculosa is generally similar to those of Mycena, Galerina, or Hypholoma. Smith noted a superficial resemblance to Psathyrella fagicola, based on similarities in the nature of the cap cuticle, the coloring, and the stem base covered in silky fibers. Psilocybe pelliculosa may be distinguished from Psathyra fagicola by the presence of a partial veil, firm gills, and smaller fruit bodies. P. pelliculosa is frequently mistaken for the widespread P. semilanceata, but the latter can be distinguished by its larger spores and a conical, papillate cap. Another similar species is Psilocybe silvatica, and a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between the two species. P. silvatica, found from New York to Michigan and north to Canada, has longer spores.  P. pelliculosa has a general resemblance to Hypholoma dispersum, a species found in northern North America and Europe.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "The fruit bodies of P. pelliculosa grow in groups or clusters on moss, forest debris, and humus in coniferous forests. The fungus prefers to fruit in disturbed areas such as trails and abandoned forest roads; it is not commonly found in grasslands. It is known from the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it has been collected in  California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and it is widely distributed in British Columbia, Canada. It is also found in northern Europe, a single collection from Finland. The fungus often fruits along forest paths and abandoned logging roads where alders and firs are growing. Fruit bodies tend to appear in late summer to early winter after cool, wet weather.",
    "Psychoactivity": "Psilocybe pelliculosa contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, and is used as a recreational drug. In terms of psychoactive potency, Stamets considers the species \"relatively weak\". Psilocybin levels have been reported to range from 1.2 to 1.7 milligrams per gram of dried mushroom, while baeocystin was measured at 0.04%.",

  "Retiboletus ornatipes": {
    "Introduction": "Retiboletus ornatipes, commonly known as the ornate-stalked bolete or goldstalk, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. Originally named Boletus ornatipes by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1878, it was transferred to Retiboletus in 2002.\nThe convex cap is 4–20 centimetres (1+1⁄2–8 in) wide and yellow, gray, or brown, staining orangish. The stem is 6–12 cm (2+1⁄4–4+3⁄4 in) tall and 1–2.5 cm (1⁄2–1 in) thick. The flesh is yellow with a mild to bitter taste. The spore print is tannish brown.\nIt can be found under oak and beech in eastern North America from July to September.\nOne guide lists the species as inedible, while another says it is choice. They reportedly tend to be edible if not bitter."

  "Rhytisma acerinum": {
    "Introduction": "Rhytisma acerinum is a plant pathogen that commonly affects sycamores and maples in late summer and autumn, causing tar spot. Tar spot does not usually have an adverse effect on the trees' long-term health. R. acerinum is an Ascomycete fungus that locally infects the leaves of trees and is a biotrophic parasite. The disease is cosmetic and is therefore usually controlled only with sanitation methods.",
    "Symptoms and signs": "In late spring, chlorotic spots appear on tree leaves. These develop into brown-black lesions, retaining the yellow border. The lesions continue to grow, and by the end of summer form leaf spots that look like tar. The spot can grow up to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in diameter. A microscopic sign of the pathogen are the stroma, mats of hyphae found in the lesions. These lesions can cause senescence of leaves but are mostly of cosmetic importance.",
    "Affected species": "Rhytisma acerinum can occur in many tree species, with the most commonly affected genus being Acer. The species most commonly affected by the disease are Norway maple (Acer platanoides), silver maple (Acer saccharinum), and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus).",
    "Disease cycle": "Rhytisma acerinum is the teleomorph of tar spot. In the spring, needle-shaped ascospores are released from overwintering apothecia in fallen leaf debris. These spores are disseminated by the wind and have a sticky coat to attach to new healthy leaves. Once on the leaves, the spores germinate and penetrate through the stoma. The subsequent infection causes chlorosis of the leaves in localized yellow spots. As the season continues into summer, apothecia begin to form, giving rise to brown-black leaf lesions that resemble spots of tar. Leaves retain their yellow border from the initial chlorosis. Apothecia survive in the fallen plant debris over winter, releasing spores when the temperature is warm again. The infection of Tar Spot is localized to the chlorotic areas on the leaves and is mostly a cosmetic issue, rather than an economically detrimental disease.\nThe anamorph of tar spot is Melasmia acerina. In late summer, conidiophores are formed in the mass of fungal tissue called the stroma. Stroma is located in the black lesions of the infected leaves. Conidiophores form non-infectious conidia that are released both in conditions of wetness and drought. The most favorable environment for the pathogen is when there is an extended period of moisture such as fog or rain, which prevents the leaves from drying out. Young trees growing in shade are therefore more susceptible. Under these conditions, conidiophores excrete a milky substance of conidia. In times of drought, the conidia stick together as one unit and form yellowish tendrils. Because the conidia are not infectious, this stage is not seen as often as the teleomorph, and it is not certain why the spores are produced.",
    "Geographical occurrence": "Tar spot is most commonly found in Europe and North America. It was thought to be a useful pollution indicator because it is not found in areas with high amounts of sulfur dioxide. However, while sulfur dioxide is toxic to the fungus in laboratory studies (sulfur dioxide prevents stroma from causing subsequent infections), no correlation was found between pollution levels and the disease. Instead, it was found that in urban areas fallen (infected) leaves were more likely to be swept up and removed, thus removing a source of infection for the plants.\nAs mentioned previously, the disease appears in the summer especially in times of wetness, but it can also develop through a drier season.",
    "Disease control": "Tar spot is a localized disease that causes mostly cosmetic symptoms and is therefore not a highly controlled disease. One of the best ways to manage the pathogen is through proper sanitation techniques. Because the fungus overwinters in diseased leaf debris, removing the debris in fall can help reduce the occurrence of the disease. In certain severe cases, fungicides can be implemented to help with control. Copper fungicides sprayed in early spring when leaves are budding and twice more throughout the season help reduce the disease. However, chemical control is not normally used because this disease is mostly cosmetic. Resistant varieties are unknown. Also, because the affected tree species are of low economic value, yield reduction is of little concern to growers. By far the most important practice is to keep a clean yard and remove as much debris as possible.",
    "Significance": "Tar spot has been recognized since 1794, when it was discovered in Europe by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, a prominent mycologist of that time. Tar spot has little historical importance because of its cosmetic nature. However, equine atypical myopathy has been associated with the ingestion of tar spot infected maple leaves. This disease causes the complete degeneration of muscle fibers and subsequent death in horses."

  "Sarcomyxa serotina": {
    "Introduction": "Sarcomyxa serotina is a species of fungus in the family Sarcomyxaceae. Its recommended English name in the UK is olive oysterling. In North America it is known as late fall oyster or late oyster mushroom.",
    "Description": "The fruit bodies predominately comprise greenish, overlapping fan- or oyster-shaped caps. The caps are up to 9 centimetres (3+1⁄2 in) wide. The gills on the underside are closely spaced, bright orange yellow, and have an adnate to decurrent attachment to the short and stout stem. The spores are smooth, amyloid, and measure 4–6 by 1–2 μm; they produce a cream to yellow spore print.",
    "Habitat": "It grows on fallen hardwood and sometimes conifers in cold weather in North America, serving as an indicator that the mushroom season is nearly over.",
    "Uses": "The species is considered to be either edible but not choice or inedible, with a flavour ranging from mild to bitter. Research has revealed that two separate species exist, Sarcomyxa serotina and S. edulis (unknown in Europe). The latter is cultivated for food in China and Japan.\n\n\nReferences"

    "Distribution": "This species is found in Europe and the Northeast of North America where it can be separated from Sarcoscypha dudleyi on spore characteristics.",
    "Description": "This species is found growing on fallen pieces of dead hardwood among mosses and leaf litter in damp habitats in winter and early spring. The fruiting body is cup-shaped with a scarlet smooth, shiny interior. The exterior is covered with a felted mass of short hairs in varying shades of white and pink and a stubby stem. The flesh is white and rubbery with a thin red layer lining the cup. The spore print is white and the spores are ellipsoidal with flattened ends and containing several oil droplets. On the outside of the cup the hairs are curly or corkscrew shaped. These features distinguishes this species from the rather similar Sarcoscypha coccinea and Sarcoscypha jurana It is reported to grow on the dead wood of such hosts as Alnus incana, species of Salix, Acer and Robinia. It is part of a complex of species which includes Sarcoscypha coccinea and Sarcoscypha dudleyi.\nSarcoscypha austriaca is generally considered inedible, but is considered edible by the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging. \n\n\nReferences"

  "Sarcosoma globosum": {
    "Introduction": "Sarcosoma globosum, or witches cauldron, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It was first described in 1793 by Casimir Christoph Schmidel. Johann Xaver Robert Caspary transferred it to the genus Sarcosoma in 1891.\nAlso known as the charred-pancake cup, it is a near-threatened fungus native to Northern Europe. It is rarely found in some parts of northeastern North America, particularly in the Great Lakes region. To biologists' surprise, in 2021 it was found in Northern British Columbia.\nThe witches cauldron is an ascomycete or sac fungus, meaning that its microscopic structure utilizes the ascus, a spore-bearing cell, for sexual reproduction. It is a detritivore, and survives on decomposing plant matter, most commonly leaf litter. It is found in spruce forests and does not currently have any human uses.",
    "Description and range": "Sarcosoma globosum is most commonly studied in Northern Europe, particularly Sweden. However, its population has been in decline for the past 50 years. The organism's preference of well-drained, nutrient-rich soil near rivers and streams within light spruce forests has caused the fungus to go extinct in several central European countries.\nIt is native to Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United States. It has been classified as extirpated in Germany, Lithuania, and Slovakia.",
    "Ecology": "The witches cauldron is found along streams and brooks in Northern Europe, where it has been studied and observed most thoroughly in Estonia, Finland, and Sweden, while in Norway it has become nearly extinct. The fruit bodies of the Sarcosoma globosum are described as big, round, and barrel-like, 5–10 centimetres (2–4 in) in diameter. Dark brown and even blackish in color, the witches cauldron can be glossy and velvety with a gelatinous substance inside. Its fruit bodies flatten and wrinkle with time.\nThe striking appearance of the fungus has made it easy to spot for tourists, who later report their findings to museums and researchers.",
    "Conservation threats to habitat": "Some of the habitats of this fungus have been destroyed due to human activity associated with urban sprawl, such as the building of roads and houses, or forestry. However, some anthropogenic habitat degradation has actually allowed the species to flourish. Dense forest is not suitable for the Sarcosoma globosum, and the introduction of grazing cattle into the agroforest actually allowed the fungus to flourish in the 1950s. The species seems to grow well in selective logging zones, but it is unable to persist in forests that have ever been clear-cut.\nThis ascomycete fungus is nationally red-listed or classified as rare in 12 countries and regions in Europe. The Swedish EPA developed a Species Action plan for Sarcosoma globosum from 2010 to 2014."

  "Schizophyllum commune": {
    "Introduction": "Schizophyllum commune is a species of fungus in the genus Schizophyllum. The mushroom resembles undulating waves of tightly packed corals or a loose Chinese fan. Gillies or split-gills vary from creamy yellow to pale white in colour. The cap is 1–4 centimetres (3⁄8–1+5⁄8 in) wide with a dense yet spongey body texture.\nIt is found on rotting wood throughout the world. This fungus is an opportunistic environmental pathogen.",
    "Etymology": "Schizophyllum is derived from [the Greek] Schíza meaning split because of the appearance of radial, centrally split, gill like folds; commune means common or shared ownership or ubiquitous.",
    "Description": "Schizophyllum commune is usually described as a morphological species of global distribution, but some research has suggested that it may be a species complex encompassing several cryptic species of more narrow distribution, as typical of many mushroom-forming Basidiomycota.\nThe caps are 1–4 centimetres (3⁄8–1+5⁄8 in) wide with white or grayish hairs. They grow in shelf-like arrangements, without stalks. The gills, which produce basidiospores on their surface, split when the mushroom dries out, earning this mushroom the common name split gill. The mushrooms can remain dry for decades and then be revived with moisture. The spore print is white.",
    "Mating": "It has a tetrapolar mating system with each cell containing two mating-type loci (called A and B) that govern different aspects of the mating process, leading to 4 possible phenotypes after cell fusion. Each locus codes for a mating type sublocus (α or β) and each type is multi-allelic: the A locus has 9 alleles for the α type and an estimated 32 for its β type, and the B locus has 9 alleles each for both its α and β types. When combined this gives an estimated \n  \n    \n      \n        9\n        ×\n        32\n        ×\n        9\n        ×\n        9\n        =\n        23328\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 9\\times 32\\times 9\\times 9=23328}\n  \n potential mating type specificities.

If neither the A nor B are compatible the result is normal monokarytic mycelium, and if only one of A or B are compatible, the result is either two mycelia growing in opposite directions (only A compatible) or a \"flat\" phenotype with no mycelia (only B compatible).",
    "Genetics": "The genome of Schizophyllum commune was sequenced in 2010.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "It is common in rotting wood. It can be found throughout the world, year-round in places such as North America.",
    "Constituents": "Hydrophobin was first isolated from S. commune. Some sources indicate that this mushroom contains antitumor and antiviral components.",
    "As an environmental pathogen": "It may be a common cause of fungal infections and related diseases, most commonly that of the lungs. They have also been reported to cause sinusitis and allergic reactions.",
    "As food": "This mushroom is reportedly edible when young. The species was regarded as nonpoisonous by Orson K. Miller Jr. and Hope H. Miller, who like David Arora regard it as inedible due to its smallness and toughness. It is chewed by some natives of Madagascar.",
    "In North America": "It is consumed in Mexico (Oaxaca, Quintana Roo and Tabasco, which are tropical). The preference for tough, rubbery mushrooms in the tropics was explained as a consequence of the fact that tender, fleshy mushrooms quickly rot in the hot humid conditions there, making their marketing problematic.",
    "In Central America": "This mushroom is sold in markets in Guatemala.",
    "In East Asia": "Known locally in Chinese as baishen (白参), this mushroom is enjoyed as food in Yunnan, China.",
    "In South Asia": "In Northeast India, in the state Manipur, it is known as kanglayen and one of the favourite ingredients for Manipuri-style pancakes called paaknam. In Mizoram, the local name is pasi (pa means mushroom, si means tiny) and it is one of the highest rated edible mushrooms among the Mizo community."

  },
  "Stereum ostrea": {
    "Introduction": "Stereum ostrea, also called false turkey-tail and golden curtain crust, is a basidiomycete fungus in the genus Stereum. It is a plant pathogen and a wood decay fungus. The name ostrea, from the word 'oyster', describes its shape.\nWith concentric circles of many colors, it highly resembles Trametes versicolor, turkey-tail, and is thus called the 'false turkey-tail'. The stemless fruiting body is shell-like and grows 1–7 cm (0.39–2.76 in) high. It is tough and inedible. It grows on tree bark. This fungus is native to the island of Java, Indonesia and has been misapplied to the North American Stereum species Stereum fasciatum, Stereum lobatum, and Stereum subtomentosum.",
    "Description": "It gets its name 'false turkey-tail' because it mimics Trametes versicolor. They can be distinguished as  T. versicolor has numerous pores on the underside of its fruiting body, unlike S. ostrea. Also, S. ostrea is more red in color. Factors such as its relatively large size and shell-like (not flat) body distinguish it from other members of the genus Stereum.\nThe fruiting body is 1–7 cm (0.39–2.76 in) wide, shaped like a shell and thin. Its surface can be hairy or smooth at the very first, growing smoother with age. The concentric zones can have a variety of colors - ranging from yellowish red to a dark brown. If algae grow on it, the color can change to green. The flesh is very thin and too tough to eat, with no distinct odor. The fungus lacks a stem. The underside is smooth and lacks pores, white to gray or a reddish-brown shade in color. The spore is white, and measures 5.5–7.5 μm (0.0055–0.0075 mm) x 2–3 μm (0.0020–0.0030 mm).\nIt is inedible.",
    "Chemical properties": "Stereum ostrea produces lignolytic enzymes, which decompose lignin. The enzyme production was compared for ten days with Phanerochaete chrysosporium, in a liquid medium. S. ostrea produced a higher number of laccase, lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase enzymes. the discoloration of the dye Remazol confirmed the presence of enzymes.\nMethoxylaricinolic acid and laricinolic acid have been isolated from this mushroom. Sterostreins A–E (1, 2, 3a/3b, 4, and 5) have been found in S. ostrea, of which sterostrein A showed antimalarial activity and was cytotoxic.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Stereum ostrea is saprophytic in nature. It is a plant pathogen, growing on hardwood tree barks, especially oak, and decaying parts. It leaves white deposits in these places. It grows individually, but in a dense manner. Phlebia incarnata, another fungus, is most commonly found growing alongside or even intermingled with this species. This fungus can be parasitized by jelly fungi. It grows all  year round and is found in Indonesia."

  "Stropharia aeruginosa": {
    "Introduction": "Stropharia aeruginosa, commonly known as the blue-green stropharia, or verdigris agaric, is a medium-sized green, slimy woodland mushroom, found on lawns, mulch and woodland from spring to autumn. The edibility of this mushroom is controversial; some sources claim that it is edible, while others claim it to be poisonous, although effects are little known and its toxic constituents undescribed.",
    "Taxonomy": "The French mycologist Lucien Quélet gave the species its current binomial name in 1872, after it was initially described as Agaricus aeruginosus by William Curtis in 1784. The Dutch mycologist Machiel Noordeloos placed it in the genus Psilocybe in 1995. The specific epithet aerūgǐnōsa is Latin for \"covered in verdigris\".",
    "Description": "The cap is convex, broadening, and becoming umbonate with age. It is 2–8 centimetres (3⁄4–3+1⁄4 in) wide. At first it is a vivid blue/green, and very glutinous (slimy), with a sprinkling of white veil remnants around the edge. The colour in the gluten fades, or is washed off as it matures, and it becomes yellow ocher, sometimes in patches, but mostly at the centre. Finally, it will lose the blue-green coloration completely. The white stem is quite long and of uniform thickness. It has a fragile brown/black ring, and below this the stem is covered in fine white scales, or flakes. The gills are initially white, then clay-brown, and sometimes have a white edge. The spore print is brownish-purple, and the oval spores 7–10 x 5 μm.",
    "Similar species": "Stropharia caerulea Kreisel – a dowdier cousin.\nStropharia pseudocyanea (Desm.) Morgan –  a smaller; slighter, but strikingly similar grassland species, with a very fleeting ring.\nPsilocybe species stain blue and lack fluffy stems.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "This mushroom is common in grassy woods, and on roadside verges in Europe including  Britain,  Asia (Iran) and parts of North America, growing on rotting wood. It particularly favours wood-chip mulches in gardens, and parks.",
    "Edibility and toxicity": "The verdigris agaric is reported as poisonous in many guidebooks printed in the Western Hemisphere, but the effect of poisoning and toxic constituents are unclear.\nAccording to some European guidebooks the verdigris agaric is edible, but undesirable to some due to a mildly spicy taste."

  "Stropharia ambigua": {
    "Introduction": "Stropharia ambigua, sometimes known as the questionable Stropharia or ambiguous stropharia, is a saprotrophic agaric mushroom, commonly fruiting in leaf litter and wood chips in the Pacific Northwest. Its edibility is debated.",
    "Description": "The cap is 3 to 15 cm (1+1⁄4 to 6 in) broad, obtuse to convex, becoming flat or uplifted in age; it has a smooth surface, is slimy when moist, and yellowish. The edge may have bits of white veil hanging from it. The flesh is white, thick, and soft. The gills are pale gray and gradually darkens to purplish-gray or purplish-black. The gills occasionally pull away from the stipe with age.\nThe stipe is 6 to 18 cm (2+1⁄4 to 7 in) long, 1–2 cm wide, and is stuffed or hollow. It may have bits of white veil hanging from it and, less commonly, a brittle ring. The veil is soft and white. The spore print is dark purplish to nearly black. The species fruits in the spring and fall. It does not have a volva. The species has been said to taste like old leaves.",
    "Similar species": "Within the genus, it can resemble Stropharia aeruginosa, S. coronilla, S. riparia, and S. semiglobata. Leratiomyces percevalii is another potential lookalike.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Stropharia ambigua appears in late fall as a solitary to scattered mushroom or in groups on rich humus, usually under conifers. It can also be found with alder and other hardwoods in the Pacific Coast. It has frequently been found in disturbed areas, such as where wood was handled. The species will colonize outdoor mushroom beds after wood chips have been decomposed by a primary saprotroph. It favors a cold and damp environment.",
    "Edibility": "Alexander Hanchett Smith and Nancy S. Weber state that the species is not poisonous. Contrarily, one source regards it as possibly poisonous. Because of conflicting reports on its edibility, the authors David Arora, Orson K. Miller, Jr. and Hope Miller do not recommend eating the species."
  },
  "Suillus americanus": {
    "Introduction": "Suillus americanus is a species of fungus in the mushroom family Suillaceae. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom and the American suillus, the mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores on the underside of the cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S. americanus may be the same species as S. sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia.    \nSuillus americanus grows in a mycorrhizal association with eastern white pine and is found where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. Susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies. The mushroom is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.",
    "Taxonomy": "Suillus americanus was first described scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888, based on specimens he had originally collected as far back as 1869, in New York state, near Sand Lake, Albany, and Port Jefferson. In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus (now known as Suillus flavidus) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist (published in 1872). However, as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's field notes that year (which served as the basis for the report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to designate a type specimen, one of the Sand Lake specimens was lectotypified in 1986.\nIn 1931, French mycologist Édouard-Jean Gilbert transferred the species to the genus Ixocomus, a now-defunct taxon that has since been subsumed into Suillus. In 1959, Walter H. Snell, collaborating with Rolf Singer and Esther A. Dick, transferred the species to Suillus. In his 1986 version of the authoritative monograph The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Singer included the species in the subsection Latiporini of genus Suillus, an infrageneric grouping (below the taxonomic level of genus) characterized by a cinnamon-colored spore print without an olive tinge, and wide pores, typically greater than 1 mm when mature.\nCommon names for the species include the American slipperycap, the American suillus, or the chicken-fat mushroom. The latter name is a reference to its yellow color. The specific epithet americanus means \"of America\".",
    "Description": "The cap is typically between 3–10 cm (1+1⁄4–4 in) in diameter, broadly convex with a small umbo to flat with age. The margin is curved inwards in young specimens, and may have remnants of a yellowish, cottony veil hanging from it. The cap surface is colored bright yellow with red or brownish streaks and hairy patches. When the fruit body is young and moist, the surface is slimy; as the cap matures and dries out, it becomes sticky or tacky.\nThe tubes which comprise the pore layer on the underside of the cap are 0.4 to 0.6 cm (1⁄8 to 1⁄4 in) deep, and have an adnate (attached broadly to the stem) to decurrent (running down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are yellow, and stain reddish-brown when bruised. The yellow pores are large (1–2 mm diameter) and angular, and tend to become darker as they age. The pores are slightly wider than long, so that there are about 9–10 pores per cm measured radially, but 12 to 13 per cm when measured tangentially, about halfway to the edge.  As is the case with all boletes, spores form on the inner surfaces of the tubes and sift through their openings to be borne away on the air currents outside.\nThe stem is 3–9 cm (1+1⁄8–3+1⁄2 in) by 0.4–1 cm (1⁄8–3⁄8 in), roughly equal in width throughout, often crooked, and becomes hollow with age. The color of the stem surface is lemon yellow, and it is covered with glandular dots that bruise if handled. The partial veil is not attached to the stem, and usually does not leave a ring on the stem. A whitish mycelium present at the base of the stem helps anchor the fruit body in the substrate. The flesh is mustard yellow, and stains pinkish-brown when cut or bruised.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "In deposit, the spores are cinnamon-colored. Viewed with a microscope, they are pale yellow, smooth, and roughly elliptical in shape, and measure 8–9.5 by 3.5–5 μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped and 4-spored, with dimensions of 21–25 by 5.5 to 6 μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the sides of a gill) range in shape from cylindrical to club-shaped and are arranged in bundles. Both the bases of the bundles and the surface of the cystidia may be covered with brown pigment particles. Cheilocystidia are cystidia located in the gill faces. In S. americanus, they are mostly club-shaped, often with an expanded apex, and like the pleurocystidia, are arranged in bundles, with brown pigment particles at the base of the bundles. Bundles of cystidia near the tube openings may sometimes be visible with a hand lens. Like all Suillus species, the cystidia of S. americanus will turn orange-brown in the presence of a solution of 3% potassium hydroxide.  The slimy layer on the cap surface results from an interwoven layer of gelatinous hyphae that are typically 3–5 μm thick.",
    "Similar species": "Suillus americanus is very similar in appearance to Suillus sibiricus (distributed in  western North America and western and central Asia) but the latter species associates with Pinus monticola and Pinus flexilis rather than Pinus strobus. One field guide suggests that S. sibiricus has a thicker stem than S. americanus, brown spots on the cap, and is a darker, more dingy yellow. Molecular phylogenetics analysis has shown, however, that specimens of S. sibricus collected from China and western North America, as well as S. americanus from eastern North America, are most likely \"a single circumboreal taxon\".\nAnother lookalike species is Suillus subaureus, which can be distinguished microscopically by slightly smaller, hyaline (translucent) spores (typically 7.5–8.5 by 3 μm), and an association with Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen).",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Suillus americanus is a common species, and is found growing solitarily or in clusters on the ground throughout northeastern North America, north to Canada, where it typically fruits in the late summer and autumn. It is also found in Guangdong, China, an example of a disjunct distribution. Fruit bodies can often be found in drier weather when other species are not abundant.\nSuillus americanus is a mycorrhizal species, a mutualistic relationship where the fungus forms a sheath on the surface of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis, while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).",
    "Allergenicity": "Some susceptible individuals have experienced an allergic reaction after touching S. americanus. The symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment. Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.",
    "Edibility": "This species is nonpoisonous and sometimes regarded as edible, but opinions about its palatibility are mixed. It has no odor and its taste has been reported as mild. One field guide suggests it has a \"distinctive lemony tang\", and another says, \"The yellow cap may remind you of chicken fat; it has a wonderfully savory mushroom flavor.\" The slimy texture of the mushroom has been compared to okra. One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads, for use on bread or as a dip; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use, and concentrate the flavor.  The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption. Another field guide mentions that the \"thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile.\"",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Suillus americanus contains a polysaccharide known as a beta glucan that laboratory tests suggest may have anti-inflammatory activity. Known specifically as a (1→3)-, (1→4)-β-D-glucan, its natural function is as a component of the fungal cell wall, where it forms microcrystalline fibrils in the wall that give it rigidity and strength. The anti-inflammatory activity results from the polysaccharide's ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide in activated macrophages, a cell of the immune system.",

It was given its current name by French naturalist Henri François Anne de Roussel when he transferred it to Suillus in 1796. Suillus is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from the word \"swine\". Granulatus means \"grainy\" and refers to the granular dots on the upper part of the stem.\nHowever, in some specimens the granular dots may be inconspicuous and not darkening with age; thus the name S. lactifluus, \"oozing milk\" was formerly applied to this form as it is not notably characterized by granular dots.\nPreviously thought to exist in eastern North America, that species has now been confirmed to be the rediscovered Suillus weaverae.",
    "Description": "The orange-brown, to brown-yellow cap is viscid (sticky) when wet, and shiny when dry, and is usually 4 to 12 centimetres (1+1⁄2 to 4+3⁄4 in) in diameter. The pale yellow stem is about 4–8 cm (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄4 in) tall  1–2 cm (3⁄8–3⁄4 in) wide, and of uniform thickness; it has tiny brownish granules at the apex and lacks a ring. The tubes and pores are small, pale yellow, and exude pale milky droplets when young. The flesh is also pale yellow.",
    "Similar species": "Suillus granulatus is often confused with S. luteus, which is another common and widely distributed species occurring in the same habitat. S. luteus has conspicuous a partial veil and ring, and lacks the milky droplets on the pores.  \nAlso similar is S. brevipes, which has a short stipe in relation to the cap, and which does not ooze droplets from the pore surface. S. pungens is also similar.",
    "Bioleaching": "Bioleaching is the industrial process of using living organisms to extract metals from ores, typically where there is only a trace amount of the metal to be extracted. It has been found that S. granulatus can extract trace elements (titanium, calcium, potassium, magnesium and lead) from wood ash and apatite.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Suillus granulatus grows with Pinus (pine trees) on both calcareous and acidic soils, and sometimes occurs in large numbers. It is the most widespread pine-associating Suillus species in warm climates.\nThe species is native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is associated with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) in South Korea. It has been introduced to South Africa, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Chile, and the Falkland Islands.",
    "Toxicity": "Suillus granulatus sometimes causes contact dermatitis to those who handle it.",
    "Edibility": "Suillus granulatus is edible and variously considered to be of either good or poor quality. The gelatinous pileipellis should be removed first, and like all Suillus species, the tubes are best removed before cooking. It has been reported to cause gastric upset in some cases. It is sometimes included in commercially produced mushroom preserves. The fruit bodies—low in fat, high in fiber and carbohydrates, and a source of nutraceutical compounds—can be considered a functional food."

  "Suillus grevillei": {
    "Introduction": "Suillus grevillei, commonly known as tamarack jack, Greville's bolete, or larch bolete, is a mycorrhizal mushroom with a tight, brilliantly coloured cap, shiny and wet looking with its mucous slime layer. The hymenium easily separates from the flesh of the cap, with a central stalk that is quite slender. The species has a ring or a tight-fitting annular zone.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet is derived from Robert Kaye Greville.",
    "Description": "Suillus grevillei is a mushroom with a 5–10 cm (2–4 in) cap colored from citrus yellow to burnt orange, that is at first hemispherical, then bell-shaped, and finally flattened. It has a sticky skin, often with veil remnants on the edge, short tubes of yellow (possibly staining brownish) which descend down to the bottom of its cylindrical stalk (6–10 x 1–2 cm), which is yellowish above the ring area with streaks of reddish brown below. The flesh is yellow, staining brown.\nTaste mild to slightly astringent to bitterish; odor none to somewhat metallic.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "It grows only under larch trees. Widespread in North America and Europe (July–November). In Asia, it has been recorded from Taiwan.",
    "Edibility": "Suillus grevillei can be cooked as an edible mushroom, though one without culinary  interest, if the slimy cuticle is removed from the cap.",
    "Chemistry": "The fungus produces grevillin which is characteristic of this fungus. Contain at least 11 yellow, orange and red pigments derived from decarboxylated pulvinic acids, of which 3',4',4- trihydroxypulvinone is the major pigment. Cyclovariegatin is also partly responsible for its colour.\nThe genetic and enzymatic basis for atromentin, the precursor to various pulvinic acid-type pigments, has been characterized (an atromentin synthetase by the name, GreA). A cosmid library (31 249 bp in total) has been made from the genome. The estimated gene density based on the cosmid library is 1 per 3900 bp of genomic DNA. The genome has a GC content of 49.8%.",

  "Suillus luteus": {
    "Introduction": "Suillus luteus is a species of bolete fungus commonly referred to as slippery jack or sticky bun. The fungus was originally assigned to Boletus by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, before being made the type species of Suillus in 1796. The slimy cap is typically up to 10 cm (4 in) wide and conical before flattening. A membranous partial veil connects the cap to the stem when young. Yellow tubes extend downward from the underside of the cap, which spores escape through. The pale stem is up to 10 cm (4 in) tall and 3 cm (1+1⁄4 in) thick, bearing small dots near the top. Unlike most other boletes, it bears a distinctive membranous ring, tinged brown to violet on the underside.\nA common fungus native all across Eurasia from Ireland to Korea, it has been introduced widely elsewhere, including North and South America, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The fungus grows in coniferous forests in its native range, and pine plantations in countries where it has become naturalized. It forms symbiotic ectomycorrhizal associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fruit bodies are often produced in large numbers above ground in summer and autumn.\nThe mushroom is edible, though not as highly regarded as other boletes. It is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, stews or fried dishes. The slime coating, however, may cause indigestion if not removed before eating. It is often sold as a dried mushroom.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was one of the many first described in 1753 by the \"father of taxonomy\" Carl Linnaeus, who, in the second volume of his Species Plantarum, gave it the name Boletus luteus. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective lūtěus, meaning \"yellow\". The fungus was reclassified as (and became the type species of) the genus Suillus by French naturalist Henri François Anne de Roussel in 1796. Suillus is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from swine. In addition to the British Mycological Society approved name \"slippery jack\", other common names for this bolete include \"pine boletus\" and \"sticky bun\"—the latter referring to its resemblance to the pastry.\n\nGerman naturalist August Batsch described Boletus volvatus (the specific epithet derived from the Latin volva, meaning \"sheath\", \"covering\" or \"womb\") alongside B. luteus in his 1783 work Elenchus Fungorum. Batsch placed both of these species, along with B. bovinus and the now obsolete names Boletus mutabilis and B. canus, in a grouping of similar boletes he called \"subordo Suilli\". Boletus volvatus is now considered a synonym of Suillus luteus. Several authors have placed the slippery jack in other genera: Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten classified it as Cricunopus luteus in 1881—the genus Cricinopus defined by yellow adnate tubes; Lucien Quélet classified it as Viscipellis luteus in 1886, and Ixocomus luteus in 1888; and Paul Christoph Hennings placed it in the section Cricinopus of the genus Boletopsis in 1900.\nIn works published before 1987, the slippery jack was written fully as Suillus luteus (L.:Fr.) Gray, as the description by Linnaeus had been name sanctioned in 1821 by the \"father of mycology\", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as 1 January 1821, the date of Fries's work. Furthermore, as Roussel's description of Suillus predated this as well, the authority for the genus was assigned to British botanist Samuel Frederick Gray in the first volume of his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants. The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as 1 May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work. In 1986, a collection of fruit bodies from Sweden was designated as the neotype of Suillus luteus.\nIn their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus species, Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers classified S. luteus in the series Suilli of the section Suillus in genus Suillus. This group is characterized by the presence of either a ring on the stipe (or stem), a partial veil adhering to the cap margin, or a \"false veil\" not attached to the stipe but initially covering the tube cavity. Species closely related to Suillus luteus include S. pseudobrevipes (a sister species), S. brevipes and S. weaverae (formerly Fuscoboletinus weaverae). A genetic study of nucleotide DNA reinforced the species' monophyly and low genetic divergence, with material of S. luteus from the United Kingdom, Austria, Germany and North America forming a clade, in contrast with some other species, such as S. granulatus, which were shown to be polyphyletic.\nChemical analysis of pigments and chromogens showed that Suillus was more closely related to Gomphidius and Rhizopogon than to other boletes, and hence Suillus luteus and its allies were transferred from the Boletaceae to the newly circumscribed family Suillaceae in 1997. Molecular studies have reinforced how distantly related these fungi are from Boletus edulis and its allies.",
    "Description": "The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or dark brown in color with a diameter of 4–10 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4 in), rarely up to 20 cm. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like the skin of the cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.\nTubes comprising the hymenophore on the underside of the cap are 3–7 mm (1⁄8–1⁄4 in) deep, with an attachment to the stipe ranging from adnate to somewhat decurrent. The pores are tiny, numbering 3 per mm in young specimens and 1–2 per mm in maturity. The stipe is 5–10 cm (2–4 in) tall and 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) wide. It is pale yellow and more or less cylindrical but may bear a swollen base.  A membranous partial veil initially links the stipe with the edge of the cap. When it ruptures, it forms a membranous, hanging ring. The top side of the ring is whitish, while the underside is characteristically dark brown to violet. This species is one of the few members of the genus Suillus that have such a ring. Above the ring, the stipe features glandular dots—minute clumps of pigmented cells. Below the ring, the stipe is dingy white, sometimes streaked with brownish slime. In humid conditions, the ring has a gelatinous texture. The white flesh of the entire fungus does not discolour when damaged, and is soft—particularly in mature specimens. It has a \"pleasant\" taste and lacks any distinctive odour.\nThe spore print is ochre or clay coloured, the elongated elliptical spores measuring 7–10 by 3–3.5 μm. Basidia (spore-producing cells) are four spored, with dimensions of 14–18 by 4–5 μm. Cystidia are present on both the tube faces (pleurocystidia) and edges (cheilocystidia), either scattered or, more rarely, as bundles. They measure 20–35 by 5–7 μm and have a narrow club shape. Clamp connections are not present in the hyphae of S. luteus.",
    "Similar species": "Good field characteristics for the species include the slimy brown cap, glandular dots on the upper stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is S. granulatus, which is another common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat; it is yellow fleshed and exudes latex droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, S. luteus is unlikely to be confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related S. grevillei is found under larch and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of Gomphidius glutinosus may look comparable from above but have gills rather than pores underneath. In North America, Suillus borealis and S. pseudobrevipes also have partial veils, but lack the distinctive ring of S. luteus. S. cothurnatus forms a band-like ring on the stipe that tends to be brownish rather than purplish.\nIn some specimens of S. luteus, the partial veil separates from the stipe (rather than the cap margin), leaving cottony patches of veil hanging from the cap margin. In this state, fruit bodies can be confused with those of S. albidipes. Unlike S. luteus, however, S. albidipes does not have glandular dots on its stipe.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Suillus luteus can be found all over the Northern Hemisphere. Native to Eurasia, it is widespread across the British Isles. To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan, where it was found along canals in Dashkin in the district of Astore, and as far east as South Korea. It has also been widely introduced elsewhere by way of pine plantations around the globe. It is very commonly found in Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations, despite the tree being native to California and hence not in the fungus' native range. In North America it is found in the northeastern, northwestern, and southwestern United States. According to Ernst Both, it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to the state of New York on Pinus sylvestris. DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations, supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity. Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes. Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In southwestern Australia, the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000 mm (40 in) annual rainfall. It has been recorded as far north as the Darling Downs and southern Queensland, and occasionally in Tasmania. The fungus fruits in spring, summer and fairly prolifically in autumn, following periods of wet weather. Mushrooms can appear in large troops or fairy rings.\nIn Ecuador, Pinus radiata plantations were planted extensively around Cotopaxi National Park, and Suillus luteus boletes appear in abundance year-round. A 1985 field study estimated production to be 3000–6000 mushrooms per hectare—up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb) (dry weight) of mushrooms hectare per year. This continuous production contrasts with the bolete's seasonal appearance elsewhere. The fungus is not found in adjacent areas of native vegetation. The fruiting is so bountiful that the harvest of slippery jacks has become the main reason that pine plantations are established or maintained in parts of Ecuador.\nIn southern Brazil, it has been recorded in plantations of slash pine (P. elliottii) in the municipalities of Pelotas, Nova Petrópolis and Canela in Rio Grande do Sul, and Colombo in Paraná. It is particularly common in plantations in Patagonia. Suillus luteus is the commonest bolete encountered in the Falkland Islands, where it is found in windbreaks and gardens.\nIn South Africa, Suillus luteus has been occasionally recorded under pines in Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and Royal Natal National Park.",
    "Ecology": "Suillus luteus is a pioneer species that typically establishes itself in the early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P. sylvestris), black pine (P. nigra), and Macedonian pine (P. peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P. resinosa) and white pine (P. strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P. halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P. contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S. luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.\nThe ectomycorrhizae formed between the fungus and host plant can be influenced by soil microorganisms present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, soil bacteria from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus does not require a specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S. luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S. luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\nThe fungus has been shown to provide a protective effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S. luteus, published in 2015.\nSuillus luteus fruit bodies are sometimes infested with larvae, though not nearly as often as S. granulatus or B. edulis. Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare late in the season with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.",
    "Edibility": "Suillus luteus is an edible mushroom, but the slime/pileipellis must be removed. Although some authors regard it as one of low quality, and generally inferior to co-occurring species such as Boletus pinophilus, the species is considered a delicacy in Slavic cultures (known as maslyata in Russian or maslyuky in Ukrainian or maślaki in Polish, deriving from words meaning \"buttery\"). It was highly regarded in Calabria, even more than Boletus edulis, until the 1940s when increased interest in the latter species eclipsed the former. Mushrooms conforming to Suillus luteus are exported from Chile to Italy, and, since the 1970s, the United States. As of 2002, harvesters in Chile were paid on average US$0.5 per kilogram of fruit bodies.\nIn Burundi, Suillus luteus mushrooms are sold to Europeans as cepes in Bujumbura but not generally eaten by the Barundi. Based on samples collected from Chile, the boletes contain (as a percentage of dry weight) 20% protein, 57% carbohydrates, 6% fat, and 6% ash. Pinus radiata plantations in southeastern Australia have become tourist attractions as people flock to them in autumn to pick slippery jacks and saffron milk-caps (Lactarius deliciosus); Belanglo State Forest in particular has attracted large numbers of Polish foragers.\nSlippery jacks do not keep for long after picking, Zeitmar considers them unsuitable for drying, as their water content is too high. They are suited for frying, or cooking in stews and soups, either alone or with other mushroom species. Puréeing the mushroom is not recommended, however: \"We once made the mistake of running it through a blender to make a soup. The result was a substance recommending itself for use when hanging wallpaper.\" S. luteus and other Suillus species may cause allergic reactions in some people or digestive problems that appear to result from consuming the slimy skin. The fungus is better cooked before eating, and some authors recommend discarding the glutinous cuticle and tubes before cooking. Moreover, the skin can spoil other fungi with which slippery jacks are collected.\nInexpensive powdered S. luteus fruit bodies are sometimes added to the more expensive B. edulis mushroom soup powder, a fraudulent practice that is difficult to detect by microscope because the tissues are no longer intact. This adulteration can be determined chemically, however, by testing for increased levels of the sugar alcohols arabitol and mannitol. The practice can also be determined with a DNA-based method that is sensitive enough to detect the addition of 1–2% of S. luteus to B. edulis powder."

  "Suillus spraguei": {
    "Introduction": "Suillus spraguei is a species of fungus in the family Suillaceae. It is known by a variety of common names, including the painted slipperycap, the painted suillus or the red and yellow suillus. Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomical history and is also frequently referred to as Suillus pictus. The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The stalk bears a grayish cottony ring and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales. The species bears a resemblance to several other members of Suillus, including S. decipiens, but can be differentiated by variations in color and size.\nSuillus spraguei grows in a mycorrhizal association with several pine species, particularly eastern white pine, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a disjunct distribution, and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree. The mushroom is edible; opinions about its quality vary.",
    "Taxonomy": "Suillus spraguei has a complex taxonomic history. The first specimen was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, and a formal scientific description was published in 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species—Boletus murraii—although this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their Boletus spraguei. Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, but the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming. In 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898).\n\nA 1996 molecular analysis of 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The results indicate that S. spraguei is most closely related to S. decipiens. The species S. granulatus and S. placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S. spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S. spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that S. spraguei and S. decipiens in China and the United States were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S. decipiens, U.S. S. spraguei, China (Yunnan) S. spraguei, and China (Jilin) S. spraguei.\nThe specific epithet spraguei is an homage to the collector Sprague, while pictus means \"painted\" or \"colored\". Suillus spraguei is commonly known as the \"painted slipperycap\", the \"painted suillus\", or the \"red and yellow suillus\". It is also called the \"eastern painted Suillus\" to contrast with the \"western painted Suillus\" (Suillus lakei).",
    "Description": "The cap of the fruit body is 3 to 12 cm (1+1⁄4 to 4+3⁄4 in) in diameter, and depending on its age, is either conic to convex, to somewhat flattened at maturity. The cap margin is initially rolled downward before straightening out, often with hanging remnants of partial veil (appendiculate). The cap surface is covered with densely matted filaments that are rough and scale-like. The scales are pink to brownish red, fading to a pale brown-gray or dull yellow in maturity. Under the scales, the cap surface is yellow to pale yellow-orange. While many other Suillus species have a sticky or slimy cap, S. spraguei is dry. The flesh is yellow.\n\nThe pores on the underside of the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring 0.5 to 5 mm (1⁄32 to 3⁄16 in) wide, and formed by tubes that extend 4 to 8 mm (1⁄8 to 3⁄8 in) deep. These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the stem (extending down its length). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous partial veil that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it rips the veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the stem. The stem is 4 to 12 cm (1+5⁄8 to 4+3⁄4 in) long, and 1 to 2.5 cm (3⁄8 to 1 in) thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped. The stem surface is tomentose, with scales at the top, and a ring on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color. The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow. The tissue of all parts of the fruit body—cap, pores, and stem—will turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured.\nIn deposit, such as with a spore print, the spores of S. spraguei appear olive-brown in color; this changes to clay or tawny-olive after drying. Microscopically, the spores have smooth surfaces, measuring 9–11 by 3–4.5 μm; in side profile they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore attaches to the basidia), while in face view they appear oblong. The spores are not amyloid, meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are thin-walled, four-spored, and have dimensions of 17–19 by 5–7.8 μm. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, they appear hyaline (translucent), and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer's reagent.\nVarious parts of the mushroom display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with the application of a drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH.",
    "Similar species": "S. spraguei is a popular edible among novice mushroom hunters as it is readily identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with white pine. This renders it unlikely to be confused with other species, but it shares similar characteristics with several other Suillus species. S. spraguei bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete (S. ochraceoroseus), but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with larch. S. cavipes, another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk. S. lakei is less brightly colored than S. spraguei, has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with Douglas-fir. S. decipiens has a less intensely red cap when young, but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble S. spraguei. S. decipiens generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from 4 to 7 cm (1+1⁄2 to 2+3⁄4 in) in diameter, and stem that is typically 4–7 cm (1+1⁄2–2+3⁄4 in) long by 0.7–1.6 cm (1⁄4–5⁄8 in) thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5–1 mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of hazel rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern U.S., from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas.",
    "Ecology, habitat and distribution": "In nature, S. spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S. spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. Under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S. spraguei has also been shown to form associations with red pine, pitch pine, and loblolly pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean pine, Chinese white pine, Siberian dwarf pine and Japanese white pine.\nIn North America, the fruit bodies appear as early as June, earlier than most other boletes (which generally begin to appear July–September), but they may be found as late as October. The mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H. completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.\n\nA Japanese field study found that S. spraguei was the dominant fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean pine, both in terms of ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S. spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S. spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.\nSuillus spraguei has a disjunct distribution and is known from several localities in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In North America, its range extends from eastern Canada (Nova Scotia) south to the Carolinas, and west to Minnesota. It has also been collected in Mexico (Coahuila and Durango). Furthermore, the species has been introduced to Europe (Germany, Lower Saxony; Netherlands).",
    "Uses": "Suillus spraguei is an edible mushroom. Its taste is not distinctive, and the odor has been described as \"slightly fruity\". It turns a blackish color when cooked, and some consider it choice, and \"among the better edibles in the genus Suillus\". In contrast, another source on mushrooms of Québec described the mushroom as a poor edible (\"comestible médiocre\"), and warned of a slightly acidic taste and disagreeable flavor. Michael Kuo's 2007 book 100 Edible Mushrooms rates the taste as mediocre, suggesting \"its sluglike consistency has all the palatability of unflavored gelatin.\" The book recommends frying the thinly sliced mushroom in butter or oil until it acquires a crispy texture.",

  "Tapinella atrotomentosa": {
    "Introduction": "Tapinella atrotomentosa, commonly known as the velvet roll-rim or velvet-footed tap, is a species of fungus in the family Tapinellaceae. Although it has gills, it is a member of the pored mushroom order Boletales. August Batsch described the species in 1783. It has been recorded from Eurasia and North America. Tough and inedible, it grows on tree stumps of conifers. The mushroom contains several compounds that act as deterrents of feeding by insects.",
    "Taxonomy": "Tapinella atrotomentosa was originally described as  Agaricus atrotomentosus by German naturalist August Batsch in his 1783 work Elenchus Fungorum, and given its current name by Josef Šutara in 1992. It is commonly known as the \"velvet-footed pax\", and the \"velvet rollrim\". Historical synonyms include Paxillus atrotomentosus by Elias Magnus Fries (1833), Rhymovis atrotomentosa by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst (1844), and Sarcopaxillus atrotomentosus by Ivan Zmitrovich (2004). The variety bambusinus was described from Trinidad in 1951 by British mycologists Richard Eric Defoe Baker and William Thomas Dale.\nThe species name is derived from the Latin words atrotomentosus, meaning \"black-haired\". It is still commonly seen under its old name Paxillus atrotomentosus in guidebooks. Tapinella atrotomentosa and its relative T. panuoides were placed in a separate genus Tapinella on account of their habit of growing on (and rotting) wood, and microscopic differences including much smaller spore size, lack of cystidia, and differing basidia. Their off-centre stipe also distinguished them from other members of the genus Paxillus, and genetic analysis confirmed them as only distantly related.",
    "Description": "The fruit body is squat mushroom with a cap up to 20 cm (8 in) wide, sepia- or walnut brown in colour with a rolled rim and depressed centre. The gills are cream-yellow and forked. The thick stipe juts out sidewards from the mushroom; it is up to 12 cm long and dark brown, covered with dark brown velvety fur.\nThe flesh is yellowish, and has been described as appetising in appearance, and is little affected by insects; the taste however is acrid. The spore print is yellowish to brownish and the spores are round to oval, measuring 5–6 μm long.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "It is a saprobic fungus found growing on tree stumps of conifers in North America, Europe, Central America (Costa Rica), east into Asia where it has been recorded from Pakistan and China. The fruit bodies appear in summer and autumn, even in drier spells when other mushrooms are not evident.",
    "Toxicity": "The mushrooms are not generally considered edible, but have been used as a food source in parts of eastern Europe. The species contains toxins which may cause gastrointestinal upset. There have been cases of poisoning reported in European literature. Linus Zeitlmayr reports that young mushrooms are edible, but warns than older ones have a foul bitter or inky flavour and are possibly poisonous. The bitter flavour is allegedly improved by boiling the mushrooms and discarding the water, but is indigestible to many.\nTests on the chemical composition and free amino acid levels of the mushroom suggest that they are not considerably different from other edible gilled mushrooms such as Armillaria mellea.",
    "Chemistry": "Tapinella atrotomentosa has a wound-activated defence mechanism whereby injured fruit bodies convert chemicals known as leucomentins into atromentin, butenolide, and the feeding deterrent osmundalactone. Atromentin had previously been identified as the pigment producing the brown colour of the cap, but was not characterized as a chemical defence compound until 1989.  Other compounds produced by the fungus include the orange-yellow flavomentins and violet spiromentin pigments. A novel dimeric lactone, bis-osumundalactone, was isolated from the variety bambusinus.\nSeveral phytoecdysteroids (compounds related to the insect moulting hormone ecdysteroid) have been identified from the fungus, including paxillosterone, 20,22-p-hydroxybenzylidene acetal, atrotosterones A, B, and C, and 25-hydroxyatrotosterones A and B."

  "Trametes betulina": {
    "Introduction": "Trametes betulina (formerly Lenzites betulina), sometimes known by common names gilled polypore, birch mazegill or multicolor gill polypore, is a species of fungus.\nThe caps are 2.5–13 centimetres (1–5 in) wide. Although it is a member of the Polyporales order, the fruiting bodies have gills instead of pores, which distinguishes it from the superficially similar Trametes versicolor or T. hirsuta.\nIt is inedible due to its toughness. Research has shown that it has several medicinal properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunosuppressive activities."
  },
  "Trametes gibbosa": {
    "Introduction": "Trametes gibbosa, commonly known as the lumpy bracket, is a polypore mushroom that causes white rot. It is found on beech stumps and the dead wood of other hardwood species. Fruit bodies are 8–15 cm in diameter and semicircular in shape. The upper surface is usually gray or white, but may be greenish in older specimens due to algal growth. Elongated pores are located on the under-surface. The fruiting bodies are frequently attacked by boring beetle larvae.",
    "Description": "Trametes gibbosa grows as a shelf mushroom and can reach sizes of up to 20 cm wide. As the common name suggests, the upper surface is lumpy/uneven and velvety. Sometimes magnification may be needed to see the hairs. This upper surface is white/creamy when young, but often develops greyer tints as well as green from algae settling into the hairs. The pore surface is of similar white and cream colors, also developing grayer tints in age. There are about 1–3 pores per mm that are elongated and can sometimes look maze-like or even gill-like in atypical specimens.\nThe flesh is woody and has no distinct taste.\nThe spore print, which may be hard to obtain, is white. The spores are 4–5.5 x 2–2.5 μm, elliptic to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline, and inamyloid. The hyphal system is trimitic, with clamp connections.",
    "Similar species": "The genus Trametes can be separated from other polypores by the hairy and lumpy caps, the fan to kidney shape, the elongated pores, and their relative thinness. Some Trametes (especially Trametes versicolor, the turkey tail) can look similar to certain Stereums, but a specimen of Stereum will never have pores on the undersurface, instead they are smooth underneath.\nTrametes aesculi is quite similar, but the pores are more variably circular or maze-like rather than mostly elongated. Additionally T. aesculi loses its tomentose upper surface on maturity and becomes smooth. Confusion between the two species can be settled under a microscope: the spores of T. aesculi has bigger spores, 5–7 μm in length.\nTrametes elegans is similar but is not found in North America or Europe.\nWhitish or grey specimens of Trametes lactinea can seem similar, but will have round or angular pores, rather than elongated.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "T. gibbosa is saprobic on dead hardwoods and is known from Eurasia and North America, in the Pacific Northwest and east of the Great Plains.\nIt grows year round."
  },
  "Trametes hirsuta": {
    "Introduction": "Trametes hirsuta, commonly known as hairy turkey tail or hairy bracket,  is a species of fungus.",
    "Description": "The cap is up to 15 centimetres (6 in) wide, exceptionally 30 cm. It is whitish gray, with short hairs and subtle zoning, sometimes tomentose and yellowish or darker near the margin. The flesh is tough, up to 5 millimetres (1⁄4 in) thick, with a soft gray upper layer and a whitish lower layer separated by a black plane. It is too tough for consumption.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species include T. pubescens, which is unzoned, buff in colour, and without layered flesh. T. versicolor is more distinctively zoned. T. occidentalis appears to be closely related.",
    "Ecology": "It is found on dead wood of deciduous trees, especially beechwood. It is found all year round, persisting due to its leathery nature.",
    "Biotechnology": "Lyophilized cell cultures of Trametes hirsuta yield aldehydes from alkenes, representing a biotransformation alternative to ozonolysis."
  },
  "Trametes ochracea": {
    "Introduction": "Trametes ochracea is a common polypore mushroom native to North America and Europe, although rarer than some other Trametes species. It is a related species to, and is a lookalike of the pale variety of Trametes versicolor. Like T. versicolor, it is commonly called turkey tail, and other common names are ochre bracket and ochre trametes.\nT. ochracea is a close relative of the more famous T. versicolor, so research into its medicinal value is limited yet occurring, and it is likely it is of similar medicinal value.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet ochracea, meaning 'ochre', refers to the orange, brown, and ochre colors of T. ochracea.",
    "Description": "The fruiting body is shaped similar to Trametes versicolor, having a rounded, shelf-like fruiting body that can have a wavy edge. It has no discernable stalk, and the tough flesh is 1–3 mm (0.04–0.12 in) thick, and can be up to 5 mm (0.20 in) thick at the point of attachment. The flat cap may be up to 10 cm (3.9 in) across. It has zones of fine hairs, colored ochre-yellow or orange. Unlike Trametes versicolor, there is no black layer underneath the tomentum that sits above the whitish flesh. The pore layer is creamy ochre.",
    "Similar species": "Trametes versicolor, as described above, is a closely related species to T. ochracea, and can be easily confused for the latter when looking at a pale variety, however in general it is usually darker and has smaller pores and spores. T. suvaeolens is a much paler relative, and is much less densely overlapping tiers. Several corticoid (crust-like) fungi (including Stereum) can grow as similarly zoned fruit bodies, however they have smooth hymenium, not pores.",
    "Ecology": "Trametes ochracea is a white rot fungus that mainly grows in the wild on beech and oak wood. It degrades lignin from lignincellulosic materials, such as wood and wood products, and is therefore able to be cultivated.\nThis species is likely eaten by similar or the same insects that eat T. versicolor, such as fungus moths, gnats, and the maggots of mushroom flies.",
    "Uses": "Although its leathery texture rendering it inedible, and medicinal value is pending, a methanol extract of T. ochraceus showed anti-inflammitory effects and was also shown to inhibit heat-induced hemolysis in red blood cells (erythrocytes). Certain strains have been observed to release pectinase, an enzyme that breaks down pectin."
  },
  "Trametes versicolor": {
    "Introduction": "Trametes versicolor – also known as Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor – is a common polypore mushroom found throughout the world. Owing to its shape being similar to that of a wild turkey's tail feathers, T. versicolor is most commonly referred to as turkey tail.\n\nAlthough polysaccharide-K, an extract of T. versicolor, is approved in Japan as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment, it is not approved in the United States for treatment of cancer or any clinical condition. Extracts of turkey tail or the mushroom itself are commonly marketed as a dietary supplement for various health benefits, but there is no good scientific evidence for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.",
    "Etymology": "Meaning 'of several colors', versicolor accurately describes this fungus that displays a unique blend of markings.",
    "Description": "The fruiting body is somewhat tongue-shaped, with no discernable stalk, and the tough flesh is 1–3 millimetres (1⁄16–1⁄8 in) thick. The cap is flat, up to 10 centimetres (4 in) across. It is often triangular or round, with zones of fine hairs coloured rust-brown or darker brown, sometimes with black zones. Underneath a layer of tomentum is a black layer, topping the whitish flesh. Older specimens can have zones with green algae growing on them.\nThe bottom surface of the cap shows typical concentric zones of different colors, with the margin always the lightest. There are 3–5 pores per mm. They are whitish to light brown, with pores round and with age twisted and labyrinthine.",
    "Similar species": "One similar-looking mushroom is Stereum ostrea (false turkey tail).\nOther similar species include Trametes betulina, T. hirsuta, T. ochracea, T. suaveolens, Bjerkandera adusta, Cerrena unicolor, Lenzites betulina, and Stereum hirsutum. Other species of Stereum are similar, typically with a smooth undersurface, as well as some species of Trichaptum.",
    "Ecology": "T. versicolor commonly grows in tiled layers in groups or rows on logs and stumps of deciduous trees. It is a white rot fungus which degrades lignin from lignocellulosic materials, such as wood.\nThe species may be eaten by caterpillars of the fungus moth Nemaxera betulinella, maggots of the Platypezid fly Polyporivora picta, and the fungus gnat Mycetophila luctuosa.",
    "Uses": "Trametes versicolor is considered too tough to eat, but can be prepared in many ways, such as teas and powders. It has been most notably consumed in China for thousands of years under the name \"Yunzhi\" (Chinese: 云芝).\nThe species may be used in traditional Chinese medicine or other herbalism practices.\nAlthough polysaccharide-K is approved in Japan as an adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment, neither the extract nor the mushroom preparation is approved or used in the United States for any clinical condition.\nIt is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement for various health benefits but lacks sufficient scientific evidence for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling."

  "Tremella mesenterica": {
    "Introduction": "Tremella mesenterica (common names include yellow brain, golden jelly fungus, yellow trembler, and witches' butter) is a common jelly fungus in the family Tremellaceae of the Agaricomycotina. The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow up to 7.5 cm (3 in) diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp.\nIt is most frequently found on both dead but attached and recently fallen branches, especially of angiosperms, as a parasite of wood-decay fungi in the genus Peniophora. It also grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy weather. Within a few days after rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions, including those of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The fungus is potentially edible and produces carbohydrates that have attracted research interest because of their various biological activity.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was originally described in 1769 from Sweden by Anders Jahan Retzius. It was later (1822) sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in the second volume of his Systema Mycologicum. It is the type species of the genus Tremella. Its distinctive appearance has led the species to accumulate a variety of common names, including \"yellow trembler\", \"yellow brain\", \"golden jelly fungus\", and \"witches' butter\". This latter name is also applied to both Exidia glandulosa and Fuligo septica, and stems from Swedish and Scandinavian folklore surrounding witchcraft, in which a bile spewed up by thieving \"carriers\" or troll cats is referred to as, \"butter of the witches.\"—They confessed also, that the devil gives them a beast, about the shape and bigness of a cat, which they call a carrier ; and he gives them a bird, too, as big as a raven, but white : And these creatures they can send any where and wherever they come, they take away all sorts of victuals they can get, as butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all sorts of seeds, whatever they can find, and carry it to the witches. What the bird brings, they may keep for themselves : but what the carrier brings, they must reserve for the devil, and that is brought to Blockula, where he gives them of it as much as he thinks fit. —They added, that the carriers filled themselves so full oftentimes, that they are forced to spew by the way, which spewing is found in several gardens, where colworts grow, and not far from the houses of the witches. It is of a yellow colour like gold, and is called the butter of the witches.\nThe species formerly recognized as Tremella lutescens is now seen as a form of T. mesenterica with washed-out colors and considered a synonym.\nBased on molecular analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 regions of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer regions of rRNA, T. mesenterica is most closely related to T. coalescens, T. tropica, and T. brasiliensis. This analysis included 20 of the estimated 120 Tremella species.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet is a Latin adjective formed from the Ancient Greek word μεσεντέριον (mesentérion), \"middle intestine\", from μεσο- (meso-, \"middle, center\") and ἔντερον (énteron, \"intestine\"), referring to its shape.",
    "Description": "The fruit body has an irregular shape, and usually breaks through the bark of dead branches. It is up to 7.5 cm (3 in) broad and 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) high, rounded to variously lobed or brain-like in appearance. The fruit body is gelatin-like but tough when wet, and hard when dry. The surface is usually smooth, the lobes translucent, deep yellow or bright yellow-orange, fading to pale yellow, rarely unpigmented and white or colorless. The fruit bodies dry to a dark reddish or orange. The spores, viewed in mass, are whitish or pale yellow.",
    "Life cycle": "Tremella mesenterica has a yeastlike phase in its life cycle that arises as a result of budding of basidiospores. The alternation between asexual and sexual propagation is achieved by mating of yeast-form haploid cells of two compatible mating types. Each mating type secretes a mating pheromone that elicits sexual differentiation of the target cell having the opposite mating type to the pheromone-producing cell. The sexual differentiation is characterized by the arrest of the growth in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle and subsequent formation of an elongated mating tube. Formation of the mating tube, initiated by the pheromones A-10 and a-13, is similar to the process of bud emergence during bipolar budding in yeasts. Tremerogen A-10 has been purified and its chemical structure found to be S-polyisoprenyl peptide. Fruit bodies arise from a primordium located beneath the wood bark, and sometimes more than one fruit body can originate separately from the same primordia.",
    "Microscopic characteristics": "The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are ellipsoid to roughly spherical in shape, not or rarely stalked, and typically 15–21 μm wide. They contain two to four septa that divide it into compartments; the septa are most frequently diagonal or vertical. Asexual reproduction in T. mesenterica is carried out through the formation of spores called conidia, which arise from conidiophores—specialized hyphal cells that are morphologically distinct from the somatic hyphae.  The conidiophores are densely branched and normally abundant in the hymenium; young specimens may be entirely conidial. The conidia are roughly spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoid, and about 2–3 by 2–2.5 μm.  They may be so numerous that young fruit bodies may be covered in a bright yellow, conidial slime. The spores are broadly ellipsoid to oblong, on average 10–16 by 6–9.5 μm; they germinate by germ tube or by yeast-like conidia of identical form to the conidia produced on the conidiophores.",
    "Similar species": "Tremella mesenterica  is frequently confused with Tremella aurantia, a widespread species parasitic on the plant pathogenic fungus Stereum hirsutum. Tremella aurantia can often be recognized by the presence of its host, which typically grows on logs, stumps, and trunks. Though the two species are similarly colored, the surface of T. aurantia is usually matte, not greasy or shiny, and its lobes or folds are thicker than those of T. mesenterica. Fruit bodies of T. aurantia contain unclamped, thick-walled host hyphae and consequently retain their shape when dried, rather than shriveling or collapsing to a film (as in T. mesenterica). Microscopically, T. aurantia has smaller basidia and smaller, differently shaped spores measuring 8.5–10 by 7–8.5 μm. T. brasiliensis, known from neotropical areas and Japan, and the North American species T. mesenterella are also similar.\nTremella mesenterica may also be confused with members of the family Dacrymycetaceae, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D. palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D. chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.\nNaematelia aurantia is less frequently translucent and can be distinguished by host.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Tremella mesenterica has a cosmopolitan distribution, having been recorded from North, Central, and South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout the year. In British Columbia, Canada, it is sometimes found on maple, poplar, or pine, but is most abundant on red alder. It prefers to grow in habitats ranging from mesic to wet. The fungus grows parasitically on the mycelium of wood-rotting corticioid fungi in the genus Peniophora. Occasionally, T. mesenterica and its host fungus are found fruiting together.",
    "Uses": "Although some have categorized the fungus as inedible or merely \"non-poisonous\", other sources say that it is edible but flavorless. The gelatinous to rubbery consistency lends texture to soups. In China, the fungus is used by vegetarians to prepare \"an immunomodulating cooling soup with lotus seed, lily bulbs, jujube, etc.\"",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides that are of interest to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T. mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T. mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects."

    "Introduction": "Tricholoma murrillianum is a species of mushroom-forming fungus found in North America also known as the ponderosa mushroom, pine mushroom, and Western matsutake. It produces a choice edible mushroom but can be confused with the poisonous Amanita smithiana.",
    "Taxonomy": "It belongs to the genus Tricholoma in the matsutake species complex, which includes the closely related East Asian songi or matsutake as well as the American matsutake (T. magnivelare) and Mexican matsutake (T. mesoamericanum), found in southern North America.\nIt was previously included with the American matsutake, T. magnivelare, but in 2017 research based on molecular analysis separated the two and determined that T. magnivelare is limited to the eastern half of North America.",
    "Description": "It is a gilled mushroom, colored mostly white with hints of tan. It is ectomycorrhizal.\nThe cap grows up to 18 centimetres (7 in) wide. The gills are very close. The stem is up to 14 cm (5+1⁄2 in) long with partial veil remnants present. The taste is mild. The spore print is white.",
    "Similar species": "The Western matsutake can be distinguished from its Asian counterparts by its whiter color, and from its North American counterparts by range, which does not overlap. T. magnivelare and T. mesoamericanum tend to be darker in cap coloration, though all three can stain reddish brown with handling when mature. T. murrillianum also has a smoother pileus than the eastern T. magnivelare.\nIt can also be confused with the poisonous Amanita smithiana.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "T. murrillianum is found in western North America from October to January, especially on the West Coast in sandy soil, along with pines, Douglas-fir, tanoak, madrone, and manzanita.",
    "Cultivation": "As Japanese production of T. matsutake has declined with the growing presence of the pine-killing nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, there is an increasingly global matsutake harvesting market of related species. Exports from western North America bloomed over the last four decades, driving prices to a peak in the 1990s when Western matsutakes reached up to $600 per pound. Prices have since declined dramatically, but the annual matsutake harvest still drives economies in many rural Pacific Northwest areas.\nButton matsutakes are especially prized, and illegal raking of wild matsutake patches can cause serious ecological damage. Matsutake harvests in the Pacific Northwest have been on the decline in recent years, possibly as a result of deep raking and over-harvesting.",
    "Uses": "Matsutakes including T. murrillianum are choice edible mushrooms with high desirability, especially in Asian cuisine. They are prized for their distinctive spicy odor and flavor and firm, meaty texture. Serious poisonings have occurred due to confusion with poisonous look-alikes, most notably Amanita smithiana."

  "Tricholomopsis rutilans": {
    "Introduction": "Tricholomopsis rutilans, commonly known as plums and custard, or red-haired agaric, is a species of gilled mushroom found across Europe and North America.",
    "Description": "The common name stems from the plum-red scaled cap and custard-yellow gills. The cap is convex, becoming bell-shaped then flattening with age. It is up to 12 centimetres (4+1⁄2 in) wide with an incurved margin, densely covered with red to purplish red hairs; with maturity the hairs bunch into small scales and the yellowish color beneath shows through. A KOH test produces red on cap surface.\nThe gills are adnate, yellow, and close with many short gills. The stem is 5–11 cm (2–4+1⁄4 in) tall, 8–25 mm (3⁄8–1 in) thick with a red scaly base fading to yellow towards the gills. In age it may be entirely yellow.\nThe flesh is yellow to cream-coloured and spore print creamy white. The spores are cream colored, 5–7 x 3–5 μm, almost globe shaped to broadly ellipsoid, smooth, and clear like glass in KOH.\nThe basidia have 4 protrusions, the cheilocystidia 50–70+ x 20–25 μm; shaped like a ball on a stick to sack shaped or swollen-irregular, smooth, thin-walled, clear in KOH. Pleurocystidia scattered, 30-35 x 5–7 μm, flask shaped to almost cylindrical, smooth, clear in KOH.",
    "Similar species": "A related species, Tricholomopsis decora, is also found in conifer woods but is golden in colour, much less common and found at higher altitudes. T. flammula is smaller and has a yellower stem. Megacollybia fallax is similar but with a gray-brown cap. Gymnopilus luteofolius grows in clusters and with scales on the cap.",
    "Distribution and habitat": "Tricholomopsis rutilans can be found growing on tree stumps and logs (especially those of spruce) in coniferous woodlands throughout the northern hemisphere, in places as diverse as Ireland, Bulgaria, Ukraine and northwest Russia, in late summer and autumn (June until November). It has also been found, probably accidentally introduced, in Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand and Costa Rica on introduced pine trees.\nIt is saprobic on the well-decayed wood of conifers, also occasionally reported in woodchips, sawdust, and lignin-rich soil. It grows alone, scattered or gregariously, and is widely distributed in North America.",
    "Edibility": "Many older texts list T. rutilans as apparently able to be eaten after boiling, though not recommended. A couple of more recent books list it as of poor quality, reportedly due to a taste of rotting wood."

  "Tylopilus felleus": {
    "Introduction": "Tylopilus felleus, commonly known as the bitter bolete or the bitter tylopilus, is a fungus of the bolete family. French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described this species as Boletus felleus in 1788 before it was transferred into the new genus Tylopilus. It is the type species of Tylopilus and the only member of the genus found in Europe.\nThe fruit bodies have convex to flat caps that are some shade of brown, buff or tan and typically measure up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter. The pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish with age. Like most boletes it lacks a ring and it may be distinguished from Boletus edulis and other similar species by its unusual pink pores and the prominent dark-brown net-like pattern on its stalk.\nIts distribution includes east Asia, Europe and eastern North America, extending south into Mexico and Central America. A mycorrhizal species, it grows in deciduous and coniferous woodland, often fruiting under beech and oak. It has been the subject of research into bioactive compounds that have been tested for antitumour and antibiotic properties. Although not poisonous it is generally considered inedible owing to its overwhelming bitterness.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described in the scientific literature as le bolet chicotin (Boletus felleus) by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1788. As the large genus Boletus was carved up into smaller genera,  Petter Karsten transferred it in 1881 to Tylopilus, a genus diagnosed by its pink spores and adnate tubes. Tylopilus felleus is the type species of Tylopilus and the only member of the genus found in Europe. Synonyms include Boletus alutarius, described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815 and later by Friedrich Wilhelm Gottlieb Rostkovius in 1844, and Paul Christoph Hennings's subsequent transfer of Fries's taxon into Tylopilus, T. alutarius. Lucien Quélet placed the taxon in Dictyopus in 1886 and then Rhodoporus in 1888, but neither of these genera are recognised today, the former having been merged into Boletus and the latter into Tylopilus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that T. felleus and many (but not all) other members of Tylopilus form a Tylopilus clade within a larger group informally called anaxoboletus in the Boletineae. Other clades in the group include the porcini and Strobilomyces clades as well as three other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus, Xerocomellus and Boletus badius and relatives.\nA variety described from the Great Lakes region, var. uliginosus,  was recognised by Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers in 1971 on the basis of its microscopic features, a distinction supported by Professor C.B. Wolfe of Pennsylvania State University. However Index Fungorum does not consider this an independent taxon. Similarly, Boletus felleus var. minor, published originally by William Chambers Coker and A.H. Beers in 1943 (later transferred to Tylopilus by Albert Pilát and Aurel Dermek in 1974), has been folded into synonymy with T. felleus. Charles Horton Peck described Boletus felleus var. obesus in 1889, but no record of a type specimen exists. Although some records exist of T. felleus in Australia, their spores are of consistently smaller dimensions and this taxon has been classified as a separate species, T. brevisporus.\nTylopilus felleus derives its genus name from the Greek tylos \"bump\" and pilos \"hat\" and its specific name from the Latin fel meaning \"bile\", referring to its bitter taste, similar to bile. The mushroom is commonly known as the \"bitter bolete\" or the \"bitter tylopilus\".",
    "Description": "The cap of this species grows up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, though some North American specimens reach 30 cm (12 in) across. Grey-yellow to pale- or walnut-brown, it is slightly downy at first and later becomes smooth with a matte lustre. It is initially convex before flattening out with maturity.  The cap skin does not peel away from the flesh. The pores underneath are white at first and become pinkish with maturity. They are adnate to the stalk and bulge downwards as the mushroom ages. The pores bruise carmine or brownish, often developing rusty-brown spots with age, and number about one or two per millimetre. The tubes are long relative to the size of the cap, measuring 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) deep in the middle part of the cap. The stalk is initially bulbous before stretching and thinning in the upper part; the lower part of the stalk remains swollen, sometimes shrinking at the base where it attaches to the substrate. It measures 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in)—rarely to 20 cm (7.9 in)—tall, and 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) wide, and can bulge out to 6 cm (2.4 in) across at the base. It is lighter in colour than the cap, and covered with a coarse brown network of markings, which have been likened to fishnet stockings in appearance. Described as \"very appetising\" in appearance, the flesh is white or creamy, and pink beneath the cap cuticle; the flesh can also develop pinkish tones where it has been cut. It has a slight smell, which has been described as pleasant, as well as faintly unpleasant. The flesh is softer than that of other boletes, and tends to become more spongy as the mushroom matures. It is intensely bitter and rarely infested by insects.\n\nThe colour of the spore print is brownish with a reddish or pink tint. Spores are somewhat fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2 μm. Cystidia on the walls of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0 μm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0 μm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8 μm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12 μm) globule in the pleurocystidia.\nSeveral chemical tests have been documented that can help confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of formaldehyde turns the tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a colour change to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia usually makes brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange.",
    "Similar species": "Italian cook and author Antonio Carluccio reports this is one of the most common fungi brought to him to identify, having been mistaken for an edible species. Young specimens can be confused with many edible boletes, though as the pores become more pink the species becomes easier to identify. Some guidebooks advocate tasting the flesh, the smallest piece of which will be very bitter. The dark-on-light reticulation in the stalk is distinctive and is the opposite colouration to that on the stalk of the prized Boletus edulis. T. felleus  is found in the same habitat as B. badius, though the latter's yellow tubes and blue-bruising flesh easily distinguish these very dissimilar species. B. subtomentosus may have a similar-coloured cap but its yellow pores and slender stalk aid identification.\nTylopilus rubrobrunneus, found in hardwood forests of eastern North America, is similar in appearance to T. felleus but has a purplish to purple-brown cap. It is also inedible owing to its bitter taste. Another North American species, T. variobrunneus, has a cap that is reddish-brown to chestnut-brown, with olive tones in youth. It has shorter spores than T. felleus, typically measuring 9–13 by 3–4.5  μm. In the field it can be distinguished from the latter species by its mild to slightly bitter taste. T. rhoadsiae, found in the southeastern United States, has a lighter-coloured cap which is smaller, up to 9 cm (3.5 in) in diameter. The edible T. indecisus and T. ferrugineus can be confused with T. felleus but have less reticulated stalks. The dimensions of the spores of the Australian species T. brevisporus range from 9.2 to 10.5 by 3.5 to 3.9 μm. T. neofelleus, limited in distribution to deciduous forests of China, New Guinea, Japan and Taiwan, can be distinguished from T. felleus macroscopically by its vinaceous-brown cap and pinkish-brown to vinaceous stalk and microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 11–14 by 4–5 μm) and longer pleurocystidia (49–107 by 14–24 μm).",
    "Ecology, distribution and habitat": "Like all Tylopilus species, T. felleus is mycorrhizal. It is found in deciduous and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, it will be in moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined at the base of the stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.\nIn North America it is known from eastern Canada, south to Florida and west to Minnesota in the United States and into Mexico and Central America. Its European distribution is widespread; it is relatively common in many regions but rare or almost absent in others. In Asia it has been recorded from the vicinity of Dashkin in the Astore District of northern Pakistan and as far east as China, where it has been recorded from Hebei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, and Korea.\nThe strong taste of the fruit body may have some role in insects avoiding it. The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T. felleus in North America though it seems to prefer other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).\nThe bacterium Paenibacillus tylopili has been isolated from the mycorrhizosphere of T. felleus; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect the activity of the microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes enzymes that allow it to break down the biomolecule chitin.\nFruit bodies of T. felleus have a high capacity to accumulate radioactive caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the mycelium. In contrast the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the radioactive isotope 210Po.",
    "Edibility": "As its common name suggests, it is extremely bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this it is sold in markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk, after which it can be eaten or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.",
    "Research": "The mycelium of Tylopilus felleus can be grown in axenic culture, on agar containing growth medium. The fungus can form fruit bodies if the temperature is suitable and the light conditions simulate a 12-hour day. The mushrooms are usually deformed, often lacking stalks so that the cap grows on the surface direct and the caps are usually 0.5–1.0 cm (0.2–0.4 in) in diameter. There are few Boletaceae species known to fruit in culture since ectomycorrhizal fungi tend to not fruit when separated from their host plant.\nCompounds from T. felleus have been extracted and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a beta-glucan that was isolated from the fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate non-specific immunological response. In particular it enhances phagocytosis, the process by which macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Cutibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-γ-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity."

  "Tylopilus rubrobrunneus": {
    "Introduction": "Tylopilus rubrobrunneus, commonly known as the reddish brown bitter bolete, is a bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. It was first described scientifically in 1967 by Samuel J. Mazzer and Alexander H. Smith from collections made in Michigan. The bolete was reported from a Mexican beech (Fagus mexicana) forest in Hidalgo, Mexico in 2010.\nThe cap is 5–13 centimetres (2–5 in) wide. The stem is 7–13 cm tall and 1.5–3 cm thick. The flesh is white and can bruise yellowish, with a very bitter taste. The spore print is pinkish brown.\nIt can be found under beech and oak trees in eastern North America from July to September.\nThe species is inedible."

  "Urnula craterium": {
    "Introduction": "Urnula craterium is a species of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names crater cup, devil's urn and the gray urn. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U. craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other hardwood tree species.\nUrnula craterium is parasitic on oak and various other hardwoods; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on fallen dead wood. The species is distributed in eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi.",
    "Taxonomy": "Urnula craterium was first described in 1822 by American botanist Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza craterium, based on a specimen found in North Carolina. The species first appeared in the scientific literature under its current name when Elias Magnus Fries described the new genus Urnula in 1849, and set P. craterium as the type species. In 1896, German mycologist Heinrich Rehm contentiously transferred the species to Geopyxis and declared the peripherally related Urnula terrestris as the new type species. Elsie Kupfer wrote to Rehm to clarify the rationale for his decision, and later explained:\n\nUrnula craterium was placed with its related species under Geopyxis, because Geopyxis was established by Persoon before Urnula by Fries; and that in order to retain the genus Urnula, under which Saccardo had placed Podophacidium terrestre of Niessl, [Rehm] restricted the genus to this latter fungus.\nAs Kupfer explains, Rehm did not justify why he believed U. craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre should be considered an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera proved that U. craterium represented a genus unrelated to Geopyxis, and Fries' classification was restored.",
    "Etymology": "The genus name means \"little urn\"; the specific epithet is derived from the Latin cratera, referring to a type of bowl used in antiquity to mix wine with water. It is commonly known as the devil's urn and the gray urn.",
    "Description": "The fruit bodies begin from dense, black mycelium on the surface of oak branches in contact with the ground. Starting out as rolls of cylindrical tissue 1 or more centimeters long and 3–4 mm wide, they expand slowly over the winter, and grow rapidly in the spring when the weather becomes warmer.\n\nThe goblet-shaped fruit body (technically an ascocarp) is 3–4 cm (1+1⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) in diameter and 4–6 cm (1+1⁄2–2+1⁄4 in) deep; initially it is closed, but opens as it matures, leaving a ragged or smooth inrolled margin around a round opening. The flesh of the ascocarp walls is tough and initially gelatinous, later becoming leathery. The exterior of the ascocarp is brownish black to black, with a velvety surface, while the interior spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, is brownish black in color, usually somewhat paler than the outside. The outer surface may be partially covered with small flakelike patches of tissue. When viewed with a magnifying glass, the \"hairs\" (fungal hyphae) making up the outer velvety surface are variable in length, and are thick-walled, blunt, and appear to wind from side to side (flexuous). The ascocarp is connected to a stalk that is typically 3–4 cm (1+1⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long by 0.4–0.8 cm (1⁄8–3⁄8 in) thick, with black mycelia at its base.",
    "Microscopic features": "The spores are ellipsoid or sausage-shaped (allantoid), smooth, and thin-walled. They are non-amyloid (not taking up iodine stain), and hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 22–37 by 10–15 μm. The spore-bearing cells, the asci are eight-spored, cylindrical, and measure 600 by 15–17 μm. They are operculate, analogous to having a flip-top lid mechanism to release the spores. Interspersed among the asci are thin, filamentous, branched paraphyses that extend beyond the tops of the asci.\nViewed with a microscope, the wall of the apothecium is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, and covered with a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.\n\n\nSpore development\nThe spores of U. craterium have a rapid and high percentage of germination. Germination requires only 1.5 hours, a relatively short time compared to another inoperculate species in the same family, Sarcoscypha coccinea, which requires 48 hours. Furthermore, germination is possible under a wide temperature range, from 5 °C (41 °F) to 35 °C (95 °F), and wide soil pH range; the quality and quantity of light does not affect germination, although prolonged exposure to light does reduce germination efficiency.",
    "Imperfect state": "The life cycle of U. craterium allows for both an imperfect (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because the relationship between the perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.",
    "Similar species": "Urnula padeniana, as well as most Plectania and Pseudoplectania species, are similar but are usually a more solid black and not crusty. The cup fungus Plectania melastoma is smaller and the cup not as deep. Bulgaria inquinans has a very shallow cup and Pseudosarcosoma latahense lacks the gelatinous interior.",
    "Ecology, habitat and distribution": "Urnula craterium grows singly or clustered together, usually attached to sticks and branches (especially oak) that are partially buried in the ground. The teleomorph state is saprobic, and decomposes hardwood; the anamorph state is parasitic, and causes a canker of various hardwoods, including oaks, hickories, basswood and beech. It is often found in deciduous forests, although it is sometimes inconspicuous due to its dark color, and because it may be partially covered with leaf litter. One of the first fleshy fungi to appear from March to May, U. craterium has been dubbed a \"harbinger of spring\", and is sometimes encountered under melting snow.\nThe distribution of U. craterium includes eastern North America, Europe (including the Czech Republic, Finland, and Spain), Japan, and China. It is red-listed as critically endangered in the Czech Republic.",
    "Edibility": "This species is often listed in field guides as inedible, or not recommended for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as \"mediocre\", and comments \"the devil's urn is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's not good, mind you, but it would be possible to eat it with a forced smile if your Aunt Wanda served it to you.\"",
    "Bioactive compounds": "Urnula craterium, when grown in liquid culture, produces bioactive chemicals that inhibit the growth of other fungi that are pathogenic to aspen; specifically, these chemical are antagonistic to aspen blue-stain fungi Ophiostoma crassivaginatum and O. piliferum, as well as the wood-decay fungus Phellinus tremulae. Chemicals produced by U. craterium include pestalotin, 5,6-dehydropestalotin, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-pyran-2-one, and (4S)-3,4-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-1(2H)-napthalenone. However, none of these isolated compounds inhibits the aspen pathogens in vitro, suggesting the true nature of the antifungal mechanism in the devil's urn has not yet been resolved.\n\n\nReferences"

  "Verpa bohemica": {
    "Introduction": "Verpa bohemica is a species of fungus in the family Morchellaceae. The synonym Ptychoverpa bohemica is often used by European mycologists and it is commonly known as the early morel or the wrinkled thimble-cap.\nThe mushroom has a pale yellow or brown thimble-shaped cap—2 to 4 cm (3⁄4 to 1+5⁄8 in) in diameter by 2 to 5 cm (3⁄4 to 2 in) long—that has a surface wrinkled and ribbed with brain-like convolutions. A feature distinguishing the species from true morels (genus Morchella), the cap hangs free from the top of the stem, which is lighter in color, brittle, and up to 12 cm (4+3⁄4 in) long by 1 to 2.5 cm (3⁄8 to 1 in) thick. Microscopically, the mushroom is distinguished by its large spores, typically 60–80 by 15–18 μm, and the presence of only two spores per ascus.\nVerpa bohemica is found in northern North America, Europe, and Asia. It fruits in early spring, growing on the ground in woods following the snowmelt, before the appearance of true morels. Although widely considered edible, if incorrectly prepared, consumption of the mushroom may lead to poisoning in susceptible individuals; symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination.",
    "Taxonomy": "The species was first described in the scientific literature by the Czech physician and mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz in 1828, under the name Morchella bohemica. The German naturalist Joseph Schröter transferred it to the genus Verpa in 1893. Ptychoverpa bohemica is a synonym that was published by Frenchman Jean Louis Émile Boudier in his 1907 treatise on the Discomycetes of Europe; the name is still occasionally used, especially in European publications. Boudier believed that the large, curved ascospores and the rare and short paraphyses were sufficiently distinct to warrant a new genus to contain the single species. Ptychoverpa has also been classified as a section of Verpa. The section is characterized by the presence of thick longitudinal ridges on the cap that can be simple or forked.\nThe species was first discovered in Canada by Alfred Brooker Klugh shortly before 1910 where it was referred to by another synonym, Morchella bispora.",
    "Etymology": "The specific epithet bohemica refers to Bohemia (now a part of the Czech Republic), where Krombholz originally collected the species. The mushroom is commonly known as the \"early morel\", \"early false morel\", or the \"wrinkled thimble-cap\".  Ptychoverpa is derived from the Ancient Greek ptyx (genitive form ptychos), meaning \"fold\", layer\", or \"plate\".",
    "Description": "The cap of this fungus (known technically as an apothecium) is 2 to 4 centimetres (3⁄4 to 1+5⁄8 inches) in diameter and 2 to 5 cm (3⁄4 to 2 in) long, with a conical or bell shape. It is folded into longitudinal ridges that often fuse together (anastomose) in a veinlike network. The cap varies in color from yellowish brown to reddish brown, with a pale underside, is attached to the stem at the top only, with the lobed edge free. The stem is 6 to 12 cm (2+3⁄8 to 4+3⁄4 in) long and 1 to 2.5 cm (3⁄8 to 1 in) thick, cream-white in color, and tapering upward. Although the stem is initially loosely stuffed with cottony hyphae, it eventually becomes hollow in maturity; overall, the mushroom is rather fragile. The spore deposit is yellow, and the flesh is white.\nRelative to other typical mushroom species, the spores of V. bohemica are huge, typically measuring 60–80 by 15–18 μm. They are elliptical, smooth, sometimes curved, and appear hyaline (translucent)  to yellowish. The spores, which number two (more rarely three) per ascus are characteristic for this species. The smooth, elliptical asci measure 275–350 μm long by 16–23 μm wide. The British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller determined that the asci are heliotropic—they bend toward light. As he noted, \"I cut transverse sections though their pilei, examined these sections under the microscope, and at once perceived that in all the hymenial grooves and depressions the asci were curved outwards so that their opercula must have faced the strongest rays of light to which the ends of the asci has been subjected in the places where the fruit-bodies developed.\" This response to the stimulus of light is significant because it permits a fruit body to point and later discharge its asci towards open spaces, thus increasing the chances that the spores will be dispersed by wind. The paraphyses are thick and club-shaped, with diameters of 7–8 μm at their tips.",
    "Similar species": "The closely related Verpa conica typically has a smooth cap, but it can be wrinkled; V. conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight-spored asci. Its North American range extends much further south than V. bohemica.\nAnother similar group of species are the \"half-free\" morels, e.g. Morchella semilibera, M. populiphila, and M. punctipes. These typically have a honeycombed cap attached to the stalk for about half of its length, and with ridges that are darker than the pits. In cross-section, the stem of M. semilibera stem is hollow, while that of V. bohemica usually has cottony wisps; M. semilibera usually has vertical perforations near the base, while V. bohemica does not.\nVerpa bohemica may be reliably distinguished from all similar species by its much larger spores.",
    "Distribution, habitat and ecology": "The fungus has a wide distribution throughout northern North America; its range extends south to the Great Lakes in the Midwestern United States, and south to northern California on the West Coast. In Europe, the fungus is widely distributed, and has been collected from Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, Romania,  Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine. In Asia, it has been recorded from India and Turkey.\nThe fruit bodies of V. bohemica grow singly or scattered on the ground in woods in early spring, often before the appearance of the morel, and throughout the morel season. It is often found along riverbanks, near cottonwoods, willows and aspens, often buried in plant litter. The fungus prefers to fruit in moist areas with ample sunlight. Its minimum growth temperature is 3 °C (37 °F), with an optimum of 22 °C (72 °F), and a maximum of about 30 °C (86 °F). A study of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios indicated that V. bohemica is saprobic, that is, obtaining nutrients from decomposing organic matter. It has been suggested, however, that the fungus is mycorrhizal for at least part of its life cycle.\nA 10-year study of the distribution, time of fruiting and habitats of morel and false morel population in Iowa showed that early false morels are the first morels to fruit in the spring, appearing shortly after leaves begin to form on deciduous trees. Narrow-head morels (Morchella angusticeps) fruit next, followed by the yellow or white morels (M. esculenta), then lastly M. crassipes. The fruit bodies serve as a habitat for breeding dipterans (flies), including Porricondyla media, Pegomya geniculata, and Trichocera annulata.",
    "Edibility": "Despite being sold (usually frozen) in Russia, the edibility of Verpa is debated. Although it is eaten by many, consumption of large amounts in a single sitting, or on successive days, has been reported to cause poisoning in susceptible individuals. Symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination, similar to the effects reported by some individuals after consuming the false morel species Gyromitra esculenta. The responsible toxin in G. esculenta is gyromitrin; it was suspected that V. bohemica may be able to synthesize low levels of the toxin, but this has yet to be experimentally detected. Overconsumption of the mushroom has been reported to induce coma. There are also reports of alcohol intolerance (disulfiram-like reaction) after consumption.\nAccording to one report, the edibility of Verpa is similar to that of Morchella. It should always be cooked thoroughly and, if being eaten for the first time, restricted to small portions to test tolerance. Some advocate only eating the caps and discarding the stems. Opinions on the flavor of the mushrooms vary, ranging from \"strong but not on a par with true morels\", to \"pleasant\", to \"not distinctive\"."

  "Volvopluteus gloiocephalus": {
    "Introduction": "Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, commonly known as the big sheath mushroom, rose-gilled grisette, or stubble rosegill, is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae. For most of the 20th century it has been known under the names Volvariella gloiocephala or V. speciosa, but recent molecular studies have placed it as the type species of the genus Volvopluteus, newly created in 2011.\nThe cap of the mushroom is about 5–15 cm (2–6 in) in diameter, varies from white to grey or grey-brown, and is markedly sticky when fresh. The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink. The stipe is white and has a sack-like volva at the base. Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating V. gloiocephalus from related species. V. gloiocephalus is a saprotrophic fungus that grows on grassy fields and accumulations of organic matter like compost or woodchip piles. It has been reported from all continents except Antarctica.",
    "Taxonomy": "This taxon has a long and convoluted nomenclatural history. It was originally described as Agaricus gloiocephalus by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1815 and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. The French mycologist Claude Gillet transferred it in 1878 to the genus Volvaria erected by Paul Kummer just a few years earlier in 1871. The name Volvaria was already taken, as it had been coined by De Candolle for a genus of lichens in 1805. The generic name Volvariella, proposed by the Argentinean mycologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini in 1899, would eventually be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to conserve Kummer's Volvaria against De Candolle's Volvaria was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi established under the principles of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.\n\nDespite the generic name Volvariella being adopted in 1953 the name Volvariella gloiocephala did not exist until 1986, when the placement of the species in that genus was formally proposed by mycologists Teun Boekhout and Manfred Enderle. The reason for this long interval is that most 20th-century mycologists working on Volvariella (e.g. Rolf Singer, Robert L. Shaffer, Robert Kühner, Henri Romagnesi) considered the epithet \"gloiocephalus\" to represent a variety with dark basidiocarps of another species of Volvariella, viz. Volvariella speciosa, that has white basidiocarps, and therefore would use the name Volvariella speciosa var. gloiocephala to refer to this taxon. Boekhout & Enderle showed that white and dark basidiocarps can arise from the same mycelium, and that the epithets \"gloiocephalus\" proposed by De Candolle in 1815 and \"speciosa\" proposed by Fries in 1818 should be considered to represent the same species with the former having nomenclatural priority. In 1996 Boekhout and Enderle designated a neotype to serve as a representative example of the species.\nThe phylogenetic study of Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella gloiocephala and related taxa are a separate clade from the majority of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella and therefore another name change was necessary, now as the type species of the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus.\nThe epithet gloiocephalus comes from the Greek terms gloia (γλοία glue or glutinous substance) and kephalē (κεφαλή head) meaning \"with a sticky head\" making reference to the viscid cap surface. It is commonly known as the \"big sheath mushroom\", \"rose-gilled grisette\" or the \"stubble rosegill\".",
    "Description": "The cap of V. gloiocephalus is between 5 and 15 cm (2 and 6 in) in diameter, more or less ovate or conical when young, then expands to convex or flat, sometimes with a slight central depression in old specimens. The surface is markedly viscid in fresh basidiocarps; the color ranges from pure white to grey or greyish brown. The gills are crowded, free from the stipe, ventricose (swollen in the middle), and up to 2 cm (0.8 in) broad; they are white when young but turn pink with age. The stipe is 5–22.5 cm (2–9 in) long and 0.7–2.5 cm (0.3–1.0 in) wide, cylindrical, broadening towards the base; the surface is white, smooth or slightly pruinose (covered with fine white powdery granules). The volva is 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) high, sacciform (pouch-like), white and has a smooth surface. The flesh is white on stipe and cap and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air. Smell and taste vary from indistinct to raphanoid (radish-like) or similar to raw peeled potatoes. The spore print is pinkish brown.\nThe basidiospores are ellipsoid and measure 12–16 by 8–9.5 μm. Basidia are 20–35 by 7–15 μm and usually four-spored, but sometimes two-spored basidia can occur. Pleurocystidia are 60–90 by 20–50 μm with variable morphology: club-shaped, fusiform, ovoid, and sometimes with a small apical papilla. Cheilocystidia are 55–100 by 15–40 μm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia; they completely cover the gill edge. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are sometimes present, measuring 70–180 by 10–25 μm; they are mostly cylindrical. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.",
    "Similar species": "Molecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. V. earlei has smaller fruit bodies (cap less than 5 cm (2 in) in diameter), has no pleurocystidia (usually), and the cheilocystidia usually have a very long apical excrescence (outgrowth). In V. asiaticus the majority of the pleurocystidia have an apical excrescence up to 10–15 μm long and the cheilocystidia are predominantly lageniform (flask-shaped). V. michiganensis has smaller basidiospores, on average less than 12.5 μm long. Volvariella acystidiata, known from central Africa (Zaire) and Italy, can be distinguished by its smaller fruit bodies, with caps up to 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter, and, microscopically, by the complete absence of cheilo- and pleurocystidia. Additionally, Volvariella taylori and Volvariella volvacea are similar.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Volvopluteus gloiocephalus is a saprotrophic mushroom that grows on the ground in gardens, grassy fields, both in and outside forest areas, and on accumulations of vegetable matter like compost or woodchip piles. It has also been reported fruiting in greenhouses. In China, it grows in bamboo thickets. It usually fruits in groups of several basidiocarps but it can also be found growing solitary. It is not unusual for a season of \"spectacular\" fruiting to be followed by several years with no appearance of the mushroom.\nThis species has been reported from all continents except Antarctica, usually under names such as Volvariella gloiocephala or V. speciosa. Molecular data have so far corroborated its occurrence in Europe and North America but records from other continents remain unconfirmed.",
    "Uses": "Volvopluteus gloiocephalus is edible, although considered watery and poor in quality. It was once sold in markets in Perth, Australia. Mature fruit bodies, collected in sufficient quantity, can be used to prepare soup, or added to dishes where wild mushrooms are used, such as stews and casseroles. The mushrooms are best used fresh as they do not preserve well. Young specimens of V. gloiocephalus have white gills so it is possible to mistake them for an Amanita and vice versa. In the United States, there have been several cases of Asian immigrants collecting and eating death caps (Amanita phalloides), under the mistaken assumption that they were Volvariella. A Greek study determined the nutritional composition of fruit bodies: protein 1.49 g/100 g fresh weight (fw), 18.36 g/100 g dry weight (dw); fat 0.54 g/100 g fw, 6.65 g/100g dw; carbohydrates 5.33 g/100g fw, 65.64 g/100 g dw."

  "Vulpicida pinastri": {
    "Introduction": "Vulpicida pinastri, the powdered sunshine, is a species of foliose lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. The lichen has a greenish-yellow thallus and dorsiventral lobes. It grows on conifers and Betula in North America and Eurasia. It is the only sorediate species in the genus and is distinguished by the bright-yellow marginal soralia. The lichen, originally described by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772, was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Vulpicida by Jan-Eric Mattson and Ming-Jou Lai in 1993.\nIn Iceland, V. pinastri grows on downy birch stems and branches. It is found in only a few locations in the Eastern Region and is locally classified as an endangered species (EN).\n\n\n== References =="

  "Xanthoria parietina": {
    "Introduction": "Xanthoria parietina is a common and widespread lichen-forming fungus in the family Teloschistaceae. Commonly known as the yellow wall lichen, common orange lichen, or maritime sunburst lichen, this leafy lichen is known for its vibrant yellow to orange coloration and environmental adaptability. First described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, it has become one of the most thoroughly studied lichens, contributing significantly to scientific understanding of lichen biology. Unlike many lichens that are sensitive to pollution, X. parietina grows in diverse habitats—including coastal rocks, urban walls, and tree bark—even in areas with high levels of air pollution and excess nitrogen. Its structure consists of small, overlapping lobes that typically measure less than 8 cm (3+1⁄8 in) across, with coloration that varies from bright orange in sun-exposed locations to greenish-yellow in shaded environments.\nThe lichen represents a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and green algae of the genus Trebouxia. Its distinctive orange-yellow color comes from parietin, an anthraquinone pigment that accumulates in the outer cortex and serves as a natural sunscreen, protecting the algal partner from excessive light and ultraviolet radiation. Unlike many lichens that reproduce through specialized vegetative structures, X. parietina primarily relies on sexual reproduction through cup-shaped fruiting bodies (apothecia), each of which can release up to 50 spores per minute under humid conditions. When fungal spores germinate, they initially form preliminary associations with common free-living algae in their vicinity. Additionally, the fungus can recruit compatible algal cells from neighboring lichen thalli—essentially extracting these partners—to help establish a complete symbiotic relationship.\nNative across Europe, parts of Asia, and coastal North Africa, X. parietina has a more limited and primarily coastal distribution in North America and Australia, where genetic evidence suggests human-mediated introduction. In recent decades, it has expanded inland in these regions, particularly in urban environments and areas affected by agricultural runoff, road salt application, and nitrogen deposition. The lichen grows slowly (averaging 2.6 mm (1⁄8 in) per year) but possesses considerable regenerative abilities, with fragments capable of developing into new thalli. It participates in a complex web of ecological interactions, hosting at least 41 species of lichen-dwelling fungi, while certain gastropods and microscopic rotifers contribute to its dispersal by consuming and excreting viable spores.\nThe species has high diversity even within local populations, with distinct patterns linked to both geographic location and substrate type. This genetic variability, combined with the lichen's flexible associations with different photobiont strains, contributes to its ecological success. X. parietina serves as a bioindicator for monitoring air quality due to its capacity to accumulate environmental contaminants. Historically, it was used in folk medicine to treat jaundice and as a natural dye source for textiles. More recently, it has become a subject of astrobiology research, where it survives Mars-like environments, space vacuum, cosmic radiation, and extreme cold. This resilience has established X. parietina as a model organism in both environmental monitoring and space exploration research.",
    "Historical taxonomy": "The taxonomic history of Xanthoria parietina begins in 1753 with Carl Linnaeus, who first described it as Lichen parietinus in his landmark work Species Plantarum. In his brief diagnosis, Linnaeus characterized it as a foliose lichen with curled yellowish-brown lobes and a matching surface, citing Dillenius's earlier depiction and noting its broad European distribution on walls, rocks, and wood. Linnaeus's original specimens of Lichen parietinus are preserved in the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN), both labeled with his Species Plantarum number 25. These specimens have caused taxonomic confusion, as one actually corresponds to Rusavskia elegans (formerly Xanthoria elegans), while the other has features resembling Xanthoria ectaneoides. A separate specimen in his Flora Suecica collection was later reassigned to X. parietina. Due to these inconsistencies, taxonomists designated the illustration cited by Linnaeus from Dillenius (1742) as the lectotype, with a corresponding specimen in the Oxford herbarium (OXF) designated epitype.\n\nEarly lichenologists later reclassified the species in different genera. For instance, Erik Acharius (1803) referred to it as Parmelia parietina in his work Methodus, and Giuseppe De Notaris (1847) listed it as Physcia parietina. Johannes M. Norman (1852) treated it under Teloschistes (a related genus of orange-colored lichens), calling it Teloschistes parietinus.\nThe modern genus Xanthoria was established by Theodor Fries. In 1860, he formally recombined the species as Xanthoria parietina. In his treatment, Fries recognized a distinct form, which he called Xanthoria aureola, distinguishing it from the more common form of X. parietina. He described aureola as a primary and fundamental form of the species, particularly prevalent in Arctic regions, differing from typical X. parietina in its color, rigid thallus, and preference for exposed habitats. Fries also cited Acharius, who considered aureola an intermediate between Xanthoria elegans (now Rusavskia elegans) and X. parietina. These distinctions may have contributed to later taxonomic interpretations that recognized Xanthoria aureola as a separate species.\nXanthoria parietina is the type species of the genus Xanthoria. The designated lectotype for Xanthoria parietina is the illustration cited by Linnaeus from Dillenius (1742). Due to its reclassification across different genera, Xanthoria parietina has accumulated many synonyms in the literature. In addition to generic transfers, various infraspecific taxa (forms, varieties, or subspecies) have been described, particularly regarding morphological variants. The name Xanthoria parietina var. ectanea, originally described by Erik Acharius in 1810, has a long and varied history, appearing under multiple combinations within Parmelia, Physcia, Teloschistes, and Xanthoria, before being recognized at different ranks as a variety, form, or subspecies. Another variation, Xanthoria parietina var. convexa, was described by Veli Räsänen in 1944, though its taxonomic significance has been less widely recognized.\nTaxonomists now recognize several taxa, once classified as infraspecific variants of Xanthoria parietina, as distinct species:\n\nf. antarctica (Vain.) Hue (1915) is now Polycauliona antarctica\nf. ectaneoides (Nyl.) Boistel (1903) is now Xanthoria ectaneoides\nf. ectaniza Boistel (1903) is now Rusavskia ectaniza\nf. polycarpa (Hoffm.) Arnold (1881) is now Polycauliona polycarpa\nsubsp. calcicola (Oxner) Clauzade & Cl.Roux (1985) is now Xanthoria calcicola\nsubsp. phlogina (Ach.) Sandst. (1912) is now Scythioria phlogina\nvar. aureola (Ach.) Th.Fr. (1860) is now Xanthoria aureola\nvar. australis Zahlbr. (1917) is now Jackelixia australis\nvar. contortuplicata (Ach.) H.Olivier (1894) is now Xanthaptychia contortuplicata\nvar. incavata (Stirt.) Js. Murray (1960) is now Dufourea incavata\nvar. lobulata (Flörke) Rabenh. (1870) is now Seawardiella lobulata\nvar. mandschurica Zahlbr. (1931) is now Zeroviella mandschurica\nvar. rutilans (Ach.) Maheu & A.Gillet (1924) is now Xanthoria rutilans\n\nXanthoria coomae, described from New South Wales in 2007, and Xanthoria polessica, described from Belarus in 2013, were later evaluated to be synonyms of Xanthoria parietina.",
    "Phylogenetic relationships and molecular studies": "Modern taxonomy places X. parietina in the family Teloschistaceae, order Teloschistales, within the class Lecanoromycetes (lichenized Ascomycota). It is closely related to other orange lichens such as those in the genera Caloplaca, Teloschistes, and other members of the Xanthorioid clade of the Teloschistaceae. Molecular studies have helped clarify its phylogenetic relationships. For example, DNA sequence analyses provided evidence that X. parietina is genetically distinct from Xanthoria aureola, another yellow coastal lichen that had sometimes been considered merely a variety or form of X. parietina. Their study confirmed that X. aureola is a separate species, not conspecific with X. parietina.\nMicroscopic studies have established Xanthoria parietina as the prototype species for the \"Teloschistes-type\" ascus, a structural category characterized by an apically thickened, strongly amyloid outer layer and a dome-like apex that splits longitudinally during spore release. This ascus type, originally described in members of Xanthoria, Teloschistes, and related genera, differs from the \"Lecanora-type\" by lacking a specialized discharge mechanism and instead relying on simple rupture for ascospore release. Early electron microscopy investigations of X. parietina helped clarify the functional nature of this ascus and its distinction from other ascus types found in lichenized fungi.",
    "Naming": "The etymology of the current name is rooted in its appearance and habitat. Xanthoria derives from the Greek xănthós, meaning 'yellow', with the generic suffix oria (\"pertaining to\"), and alludes to the lichen's bright orange-yellow color. The species epithet parietina comes from Latin parietina ('of walls'), referring to its frequent occurrence on walls. Thus, the name Xanthoria parietina essentially means \"yellow wall (lichen)\", a fitting description of this common orange lichen, and one of its several English common names. Other common names used for this species include \"common orange lichen\", \"yellow scales\", \"maritime sunburst lichen\", \"wall lichen\", and \"shore lichen\".",
    "Description": "The vegetative body of the lichen, the thallus, is foliose (leafy) and typically less than 8 centimetres (3.1 in) wide. The lobes of the thallus are 1–4 mm (rarely up to 7 mm) in diameter, and flattened, though in African populations the lobes tend to be smaller than those in temperate areas, typically 0.5–2.0 mm wide. The upper surface is some shade of yellow, orange, or greenish yellow, becoming almost green when growing in shaded situations. The lower surface is white, has a cortex, and sparse pale rhizines or hapters that help attach the thallus to its substrate. The vegetative reproductive structures soredia and isidia are absent in this species. X. parietina reproduces primarily through sexual reproduction via apothecia (fruiting bodies). Apothecia typically develop about 2–4 mm behind the growing edge of the thallus and take 12–18 months to reach maturity. Mature apothecia typically measure between 1.5 and 2.6 mm in diameter, though in rare cases they can reach up to 4.3 mm. They can comprise between 0–87% of a thallus's dry weight, with most thalli dedicating 10–30% of their biomass to these reproductive structures. The apothecia can release spores at rates of up to 50 per minute under humid conditions. The production of apothecia appears to be independent of the thallus's directional aspect (north, south, east, or west facing), meaning that sunlight exposure does not significantly influence reproductive effort.\nThe outer \"skin\" of the lichen, the cortex, is composed of closely packed fungal hyphae and serves to protect the thallus from water loss due to evaporation as well as harmful effects of high levels of irradiation. In X. parietina, the thickness of the thalli is known to vary depending on the habitat in which it grows. Thalli are much thinner in shady locations than in those exposed to full sunshine; this has the effect of protecting the algae that cannot tolerate high light intensities.\nThe ascospores made by X. parietina are hyaline (colorless and translucent), ellipsoid, and typically measure 13–16 by 7–9 μm. Like all Teloschistaceae lichens, they are polarilocular, meaning they are divided into two components (locules) separated by a central septum with a perforation. This septum ranges from 3 to 8 μm wide.",
    "Similar species": "Xanthoria parietina can be confused with several closely related species, particularly X. aureola and X. calcicola. Molecular evidence supports that these are distinct species, though they share morphological similarities. X. aureola was historically considered synonymous with X. parietina but is now recognized as a separate species. Compared to X. parietina, X. aureola has a thicker thallus (averaging 320 μm vs. 236 μm), narrower lobes at their widest point (averaging 2.3 mm vs. 2.9 mm), and a rough upper surface with visible crystals rather than smooth. The central parts of X. aureola are covered with overlapping, crenulate to strap-shaped lobules. It typically produces fewer apothecia, and shows an ecological preference for seashore rocks, while X. parietina occurs on various substrates.\nXanthoria calcicola differs from X. parietina by its rough upper surface with crystals, central parts covered with coarse isidia or papilla-like projections, and dull orange-yellow color compared to the brighter yellow of X. parietina. It typically has scattered apothecia when present (versus abundant in X. parietina), thalline margins of apothecia that range from smooth to rough to crenulate, a distinct chemosyndrome (a set of related secondary metabolites), and preference for calcareous substrates like stone walls, rarely growing on bark. Molecular analysis shows X. calcicola and X. aureola are more closely related to each other than either is to X. parietina, though they remain genetically distinct species with different morphological features and ecological preferences. The presence of crystals on the upper surface is a key characteristic that distinguishes both X. aureola and X. calcicola from X. parietina, which has a smooth upper surface.\nAnother possible lookalike, Rusavskia elegans, has smaller convex lobes that measure up to 1.3 mm wide.",
    "Photobiont": "The photosynthetic partners, or photobionts, of X. parietina belong to the green algal genus Trebouxia, including Trebouxia arboricola and T. irregularis. These algae also exist independently in nature, occurring on both lichen-colonized and lichen-free bark. A study found that the photobiont occupies 7% of the thallus volume in X. parietina. Pigmentation density in the upper cortex varies, regulating light exposure to the algae. The Trebouxia photobiont adjusts its photosynthetic activity seasonally, supporting X. parietina in sunlit environments. As sunlight increases in spring, the photobiont reduces chlorophyll levels and produces protective pigments to dissipate excess light as heat. Chlorophyll concentrations are lowest in spring and peak in winter, balancing light absorption and photoprotection throughout the year.\nX. parietina associates with diverse photobionts. It primarily partners with Trebouxia decolorans when growing on bark and with T. arboricola on rock. Even within local populations, genetically distinct photobionts often coexist in adjacent thalli. One study identified 36 algal genotypes among 38 epiphytic samples from a single site. Despite T. decolorans being assumed to reproduce asexually, multiple algal strains sometimes occur within a single thallus, suggesting photobiont switching or thallus fusion. This diversity may contribute to X. parietina's adaptability across varied environments.\nAlthough free-living algae are abundant, X. parietina selectively associates with Trebouxia species. Fungal proteins, including algal-binding proteins, may mediate this selection by recognizing compatible photobionts. These proteins interact specifically with Trebouxia cell walls, suggesting a biochemical mechanism for partner recognition. Bubrick and Galun (1980) identified a protein in X. parietina that binds selectively to the cell walls of its cultured photobiont, with binding strength correlating with acidic polysaccharide levels. This interaction may be crucial during lichen resynthesis, as X. parietina propagates via fungal spores and must recruit new photobionts from the environment.\nLive-cell imaging has revealed a dynamic mitochondrial network (chondriome) in Trebouxia freshly isolated from X. parietina. The findings suggest that mitochondria may be shaped by the lichenized state and contribute to energy exchange with the fungal partner. They also appear to play a role in stress responses, such as desiccation tolerance, typically studied in relation to the chloroplast. These insights may help clarify physiological interactions in lichen symbiosis.",
    "Chemistry": "Like many lichens, Xanthoria parietina produces various secondary metabolites (lichen substances), primarily anthraquinone pigments that contribute to its vivid color. Its dominant compound, parietin, is an orange-yellow anthraquinone that accumulates in the outer cortex and is sometimes referred to as physcion in chemical literature. Parietin typically makes up 2.1% of the thallus dry weight and forms a hydrophobic layer in the upper cortex above the algal layer. It is deposited as tiny crystals in the upper cortex, where it protects the photobiont. Parietin synthesis is stimulated by UV-B radiation and photosynthates from the Trebouxia symbiont. In addition to shielding against UV radiation, parietin acts as a barrier against environmental toxins, particularly heavy metals.\nParietin, an anthraquinone pigment, not only gives X. parietina its bright orange color but also protects it from visible light (400–500 nm). Experimental removal of parietin led to increased photoinhibition, especially in hydrated thalli, confirming its protective function. However, when desiccated, X. parietina remained phototolerant, suggesting that structural adaptations also contribute to its light resistance.  In addition to its role in photoprotection, parietin enhances desiccation tolerance by stabilizing cell membranes and modifying the upper cortex to improve water retention.\nParietin is highly effective in UV protection, absorbing UV-B radiation with a peak at 288 nm. This trait is particularly beneficial in UV-intense habitats such as coastal cliffs and alpine regions. Experiments confirm that UV-B light is necessary for parietin synthesis—under controlled conditions, thalli exposed only to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) regenerated 12% of their parietin, while those exposed to UV-B restored 35%. Despite lower UV-B levels in Arctic environments, X. parietina maintains high parietin concentrations, suggesting that additional environmental factors regulate its production. Seasonal field studies show that parietin levels in Xanthoria parietina follow an annual cycle. In naturally occurring populations, concentrations were lowest in winter and nearly doubled by the summer solstice. This pattern mirrors seasonal shifts in UV-B radiation, suggesting that parietin synthesis is rapidly upregulated in spring to shield the photobiont from excess light and declines more gradually in autumn as irradiance decreases.\nIn addition to parietin, X. parietina produces several related anthraquinones, including fallacinol (also called teloschistin), fallacinal, emodin, and parietinic acid. Fallacinol and fallacinal are minor anthraquinones, while emodin is another orange pigment found in some lichens. These compounds contribute to the chemical profile of X. parietina and have been investigated in phytochemical studies. Recent research (2023) has explored X. parietina as a natural source of anthraquinones for synthesizing pharmaceutical derivatives, such as O-methylated and acylated anthraquinones. X. parietina also produces the secondary metabolite 2-methoxy-4,5,7-trihydroxy-anthraquinone, as well as tocopherol and ergosterol.\nBeyond anthraquinones, X. parietina contains additional pigments, including carotenoids such as mutatoxanthin, which contribute to its photoprotective capabilities. The total carotenoid content in X. parietina can reach up to 94.7 mg/g dry weight, significantly higher than in some related species, indicating a strong investment in light protection mechanisms. Furthermore, the synthesis of anthraquinones in X. parietina is linked to its symbiotic relationship with Trebouxia algae—ribitol, a carbohydrate supplied by the photobiont, has been shown to significantly enhance parietin production when provided in culture.\n\nIn lichenology, simple chemical spot tests are used to detect certain compounds in situ, and X. parietina yields clear results due to its anthraquinone pigments. A standard test is the K test (using potassium hydroxide solution). On X. parietina, applying KOH to the cortex produces a deep purple reaction (K+ purple). This is a classic indication of anthraquinones like parietin – the KOH causes parietin to form a purple salt (a distinctive color change). Other spot test results for this lichen are negative: C−, KC−, and P−.\nIn addition to its anthraquinone pigments, Xanthoria parietina contains small amounts of calcium oxalate, a secondary metabolite that occurs in many lichens, particularly those growing on calcareous substrates. However, unlike strictly calcicolous species such as Caloplaca heppiana and Lecanora calcarea, which accumulate large quantities of calcium oxalate, X. parietina was found to contain only minor traces of this compound. This suggests that while X. parietina can tolerate limestone habitats, it does not rely on extensive oxalate production for calcium regulation or substrate modification to the same extent as obligate calcicoles.",
    "Physiological adaptations": "Xanthoria parietina regulates water balance while maintaining gas exchange, allowing it to tolerate fluctuating moisture conditions. This adaptation is largely due to the class I hydrophobin protein XPH1, which self-assembles into a hydrophobic rodlet layer on fungal hyphae in the medullary and algal layers of the thallus. The hydrophobin layer prevents waterlogging while preserving air spaces essential for CO2 and O2 diffusion. Unlike the hydrophilic outer cortex, which absorbs water, the fungal hyphae are coated with a hydrophobic barrier, ensuring continuous gas exchange even in rain or high humidity. This feature is especially beneficial in coastal and riparian environments, where frequent wetting could otherwise disrupt metabolism.\nThe thallus structure of Xanthoria parietina consists of approximately 7% algal cells, 43% fungal tissue, 18% air spaces, and 34% extracellular matrix, which may include glucan or lichenan. The air spaces reduce CO2 diffusion resistance, improving photosynthesis even when fungal walls are water-saturated.\nProtein XPH1 forms a stable, insoluble coating that enhances the lichen's resilience. It contains a leucine zipper domain, likely aiding in aggregation at air-water interfaces to prevent liquid infiltration. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that the hydrophobin layer coats both fungal and algal cell walls, forming a protective boundary between symbiotic partners and the environment. In X. parietina, XPH1 is continuously expressed, unlike in non-lichenized fungi, where hydrophobins appear only at specific stages. Laboratory cultures of the mycobiont grown without its photobiont fail to produce XPH1, indicating that its synthesis depends on symbiosis.\nThe hydrophobin layer also enhances desiccation resistance by repelling excess moisture and preventing prolonged saturation, allowing the lichen to recover quickly from dehydration. This is especially critical in exposed habitats with frequent wet-dry cycles. The hydrophobin layer may aid air pollution tolerance, particularly heavy metal resistance, by creating a protective barrier that reduces fungal exposure to toxic particulates. This may explain why X. parietina thrives in urban and industrial environments where other lichens struggle.",
    "Reproduction and dispersal": "Many lichens disperse via symbiotic vegetative propagules such as soredia, isidia, or blastidia, but X. parietina lacks these structures and must re-establish its symbiotic state with each reproductive cycle. Instead, oribatid mites—Trhypochtonius tectorum and Trichoribates trimaculatus—serve as vectors, consuming X. parietina and dispersing its viable ascospores and photobiont cells through their faecal pellets. This facilitates both short- and long-distance dispersal.\nDespite lacking specialized vegetative propagules, X. parietina demonstrates sophisticated reproductive strategies that overcome the challenges of sexual reproduction in lichens. When germinating fungal spores spread across a substrate, they first form associations with common non-symbiotic algae (such as Pleurococcus), creating a preliminary \"proto-lichen\" stage. This widespread network increases the likelihood of encountering the Trebouxioid photobiont needed for proper thallus development. Additionally, the mycobiont can extract suitable algal partners from the soredia of other lichens, particularly Physcia species that often grow alongside X. parietina and contain compatible photobionts.\nOnce contact is established with compatible Trebouxia cells, the mycobiont forms specialized structures called haustorial complexes that enable efficient nutrient exchange. These intraparietal haustoria, which penetrate partially into the algal cell wall but not into the cell membrane itself, allow short-distance shifting of photobiont cells and create pathways for carbohydrate translocation from the photosynthetic algae to the fungus. Unlike many other lichens, X. parietina can form several haustoria per algal cell, with each haustorium developed by either a single hypha or multiple fungal hyphae working together, enhancing the efficiency of the symbiotic relationship.\nXanthoria parietina follows a four-stage life cycle with 13 developmental states. After spore germination, growth progresses through protothallus (fungal hyphae only), proterothallus (initial algal association), and juvenile stages, eventually forming a foliose thallus. In young thalli, apothecia cover about half of the thallus margin, but in mature thalli, they occupy only around 1/16 of the margin. This decrease indicates that as the lichen matures, the relative area devoted to reproductive structures declines compared to the overall thallus size. Environmental conditions strongly influence development—thalli in polluted or urban areas often fail to complete their life cycle, whereas those in clean habitats reach full maturity.\nReproductive success varies by substrate—thalli on aspen trees produce more apothecia and spores than those on other species. Additionally, the mycobiont can associate with non-native algae (e.g., Pleurococcus) before establishing its typical Trebouxia or Pseudotrebouxia symbiont, enabling colonization across different substrates.\nXanthoria parietina grows at an average rate of about 2.6 mm per year, though growth varies with habitat. Moist sub-montane environments support faster growth (6–7 mm/year), while drier coastal regions slow expansion. Growth peaks in cold, wet seasons (autumn/winter) and declines in warm, dry conditions, such as Mediterranean climates. The slow growth of X. parietina influences its longevity and dispersal. Without active water uptake, high evaporative demand limits metabolism, especially in wind-exposed, low-altitude regions, where desiccation slows thallus expansion and reduces propagule success. In contrast, high humidity supports steady radial growth, allowing long-term persistence, biomass accumulation, and continuous ascospore release. Strong winds both hinder and aid X. parietina. While wind exposure dehydrates thalli and slows growth, it also disperses thallus fragments, which serve as vegetative propagules in the absence of specialized structures, supplementing spore-based dispersal.\nXanthoria parietina releases and germinates spores year-round, though germination is faster in summer (4–5 days) and slower in winter. Optimal germination occurs at pH 6, but spores tolerate pH 3–7. Germination success and mycobiont development are influenced by multiple environmental factors. Substrate affects success—germination is higher on agar than in water films. In the laboratory, the ascospores of X. parietina germinate best in liquid nutrient media, particularly malt-yeast extract, which provides essential carbohydrates, amino acids, and vitamins. Higher temperatures accelerate germination, with 23 °C (73 °F) promoting faster colony formation than 19 °C (66 °F). Light exposure is unnecessary for early fungal growth—cultures in darkness develop healthier, more extensive mycelial networks.\nDeveloping mycobiont morphology provides insights into early symbiosis. In vitro, X. parietina forms septate, branched hyphae, which later develop into lobed structures, resembling early lichen thalli. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a dense, interwoven hyphal network, potentially facilitating photobiont interactions during natural lichenization. These adaptations support X. parietina's regenerative ability and symbiotic establishment across varied environments.\nAlthough X. parietina lacks specialized vegetative propagules, it has a regenerative capacity that enhances its ecological success. Older, apothecia-covered thalli detach along drought-induced cracks, while younger margins remain attached. When fragments land on suitable substrates, they regenerate new lobes along wound margins, acting as natural propagules. Field studies show a 150% laminal size increase in just 13 months in regenerating thalli. In a five-year experiment, X. parietina maintained 50% substrate coverage, despite losing 90% of its initial thallus area, as regrowth compensated for these losses. Total turnover (growth + loss) exceeded 170%, highlighting its dynamic life cycle.\nRegeneration is driven by actively dividing fungal and algal cells within mature thallus areas, allowing new growth from virtually any part of the lichen body, including apothecial disk margins. This adaptation is particularly evident in X. parietina and some Teloschistales species, providing a significant ecological advantage over lichens that lack both vegetative propagules and high regenerative ability. This fragmentation-based dispersal contributes to the species' resilience and widespread distribution.",
    "Habitat and distribution": "Xanthoria parietina is a cosmopolitan species reported from Australia, Africa, Asia, North America, and throughout much of Europe. In eastern North America and Europe, it is more frequently encountered near coastal locations, and in Southern Ontario, Canada, its reappearance has been attributed to increased nitrate deposition associated with industrial and agricultural developments.\nThe species shows a strong preference for coastal habitats, where it benefits from marine aerosol deposition. In Maine, USA, X. parietina is abundant on gravestones near the ocean but declines sharply further inland. It becomes rare beyond 40 km (25 mi) from the coast in southwestern Maine and 130 km (81 mi) inland in eastern Maine. This inland distribution pattern is largely influenced by the deposition of marine-derived nutrients, particularly chloride and sodium, which are transported inland by wind and precipitation.\nIn North America, the species was historically limited primarily to coastal regions—along the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland to Pennsylvania, along the Pacific coast from California to the Pacific Northwest, and in a small part of the Gulf coast in Texas. Within the Pacific Northwest, its traditional range was described as west of the Cascades, from the Willamette Valley to the Puget Sound region. Since the early 2000s, however, the species has been documented in several inland cities in Idaho, Washington, and parts of western Montana. These inland occurrences are predominantly associated with urban environments, particularly in arboretums and parks on planted ornamental trees, suggesting human-mediated dispersal. These documented range expansions have identified X. parietina as one of the few lichen species to have become demonstrably invasive in new territories, primarily through horticultural introduction pathways. Research indicates that X. parietina is being transported inland on nursery stock from coastal regions, as evidenced by its presence on commercial nursery plants and absence from naturally occurring woody plants in undisturbed areas outside these cities.\n\nWind direction plays a critical role in shaping the inland extent of X. parietina. Southwesterly winds in the warmer months carry marine aerosols further inland, while easterly storms contribute additional sea salt deposition through precipitation. The influence of these aerosols is evident in Maine cemeteries: X. parietina is more frequent in open cemeteries exposed to prevailing winds, compared to wooded cemeteries, which block or capture airborne sea salts, and have significantly lower frequencies of the lichen.  In recent decades, inland populations of X. parietina have been discovered in southern Ontario, suggesting an expansion beyond its traditionally coastal range. Once considered extirpated from the region, the species was rediscovered growing on trees in several inland locations. This inland occurrence raises questions about whether the lichen has reestablished after a long absence or has persisted undetected for decades. The expansion may be linked to increasing nitrogen deposition from agricultural runoff and air pollution, which create conditions favorable for nitrophilous lichens like X. parietina. Another possible factor in its inland spread is the widespread use of road salt in Ontario over the past 50–70 years. Since X. parietina thrives in salt-rich coastal environments, roadside salt deposition may have provided an artificial habitat, mimicking the chemical conditions of maritime regions. The lichen is often found near highways and on trees growing along drainage ditches that receive runoff from fertilized fields, further supporting the role of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in its inland establishment.\nThe lichen grows on a range of substrates and in diverse habitats. It is found in hardwood forests within broad, low-elevation valleys and occurs sporadically on Populus and other hardwoods in riparian zones of agricultural and populated areas. It preferentially colonizes the upper parts of trunks (about 70% of total tree height), where the bark is younger and more exposed to sunlight. It is also abundant on farm buildings and on rocks immediately above the high water mark in coastal zones, and on rocky seashores it typically forms a distinct band in the supralittoral zone between more halophilic species below and terrestrial species above. Nutrient enrichment by bird droppings enhances the ability of X. parietina to grow on rock. The species demonstrates substrate versatility and has even been recorded overgrowing lead on lead-incised gravestones in England.\nThe species demonstrates ecological resilience through its regenerative capacity. Unlike many foliose lichens that show strict positional control of growth limited to thallus margins, X. parietina can initiate new growth from virtually any damaged portion of its thallus. This ability to recover from physical damage or fragmentation allows it to persist in disturbed habitats where other lichens might fail to reestablish.\nAdditional records indicate that distinct morphological forms occur in anthropogenic habitats. A granulose form (formerly known as Xanthoria aureola) has been recorded predominantly on roofs in southeastern England.",
    "Ecology": "Xanthoria parietina demonstrates a range of physiological and morphological adaptations that facilitate its survival in diverse habitats. Populations in drier, more exposed habitats produce longer-chain surface hydrocarbons (alkanes), whereas those in more humid, cooler regions synthesize shorter-chain alkanes—a response that helps reduce water loss, similar to adaptations seen in vascular plants. Its thallus morphology is plastic; forms in moist stream beds tend to be semi-erect and orange-yellow, whereas those in drier, sun-exposed sites are more compact and darker orange. These differences appear to be induced by environment conditions rather than genetic differences.\n\nThe lichen's survival is closely linked to its dependence on atmospheric humidity. Lacking specialized water-absorbing structures such as roots or stomata, X. parietina absorbs ambient moisture for metabolic activity. When humidity drops, the lichen enters a dormant state, suspending photosynthesis until moisture returns. This poikilohydric strategy enables it to withstand prolonged dry periods, although growth and reproduction are largely confined to humid conditions. In wetter climates, continuous hydration supports ongoing metabolism and faster thallus expansion. Environmental factors—air temperature, wind, and evaporative demand—influence its physiology: higher temperatures accelerate water loss, and strong, dry winds intensify desiccation, particularly in low-altitude coastal regions; conversely, moderate winds with adequate humidity can enhance gaseous exchange and temporarily boost photosynthetic efficiency. This balance between moisture availability and air movement is a key determinant of lichen growth rates across different habitats.\nThe thallus of X. parietina progresses through distinct ontogenetic stages that reflect its ecological adaptations. In the juvenile and immature phases, the lichen establishes its foliose form and develops a homeomeric structure with a protective upper crust. As it advances to virginal stages, the characteristic rosette shape forms. During the generative period, apothecia develop gradually, shifting from a scattered central distribution in young thalli to a more concentrated arrangement in both central and peripheral regions in middle-aged specimens; these developmental rates vary with environmental conditions, with optimal formation in well-illuminated habitats with moderate nutrient levels.\nEcological competition further influences population structure and morphology. In regions where several nitrophilous lichen species coexist, X. parietina often forms a codominant relationship in early colonization, but its higher tolerance to pollution and nutrient enrichment may eventually lead to greater dominance in altered habitats. This dynamic is reflected in the varying proportions of ontogenetic stages, with balanced age distributions in less disturbed environments and disproportionate representation in stressed ones. On rocky substrates, the lichen colonizes surfaces via hyphae emerging from its lower cortex rather than through rhizines; it can penetrate mineral fissures—especially in calcareous rocks—and on softer substrates like calcarenite, its hyphae may extend 1–2 mm beneath the surface, promoting mineral fragmentation. On harder andesite, the lichen remains largely surface-bound, contributing mainly to mechanical disaggregation rather than chemical weathering.\nAs a nitrophilous species, X. parietina thrives in nutrient-rich environments. Moderate nutrient input stimulates growth, although excessive levels eventually reduce growth rates. Consequently, it is often abundant in areas affected by agricultural runoff, bird perches, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition, where nutrient enrichment can alter lichen community structures by reducing acid-sensitive species. Bird guano, which is rich in the toxic compound urea, generally excludes most lichens from these habitats; however, X. parietina achieves one of the highest nitrogen contents reported, partly because of its high urease activity that converts urea into CO2 and NH4.",
    "Nitrogen relationships": "Xanthoria parietina is highly adaptable to nitrogen-rich environments, with thalli containing between 11 and 43 milligrams per gram of nitrogen (dry weight), a broader range than most other green algal lichens. The species maintains metabolic balance by shifting resource allocation between its fungal and algal partners, directing more resources to its photobiont under high nitrogen conditions. Unlike nitrogen-sensitive species, X. parietina sustains consistent growth patterns regardless of nitrogen concentration, allowing it to thrive in agricultural areas and urban centers. his adaptation to high nitrogen environments explains its frequent association with eutrophication and its common presence near farmland and livestock facilities.\nTransplant experiments near a pig farm in Denmark further demonstrated its nitrogen accumulation ability. Lichen thalli exposed to high ammonia levels rapidly increased their nitrogen content, reaching approximately 2.1% within a month, whereas samples positioned 300 meters away maintained lower levels (around 1.6%). In situ samples collected along a transect exhibited a strong linear correlation between thallus nitrogen content and the logarithm of ambient ammonia concentrations. Additional research suggests that X. parietina's nitrogen tolerance may be linked to osmotic adaptations rather than a direct nitrogen preference. It is primarily halotolerant and xerophytic, with cell osmotic values significantly higher than those of non-nitrophytic species. This allows it to take up water from concentrated solutions, including ammonium nitrate deposits, explaining its success in both nitrogen-polluted urban areas and coastal or dry Mediterranean climates where nitrogen levels are low.",
    "Population genetics": "Genetic studies of Xanthoria parietina have revealed significant differentiation among populations, with genetic variation structured by both geographic distance and substrate type. Populations growing on tree bark show higher genetic diversity than those on rock surfaces, though there is no evidence of restricted gene flow between populations on the same substrate type, even when separated by distances of up to 25 km (16 mi). Despite these genetic differences, no corresponding morphological or chemical variation has been observed.\nAt fine spatial scales, X. parietina exhibits high genetic diversity within local populations, with most genetic variation (up to 90%) occurring within rather than between populations. Studies using IGS and ITS (genetic markers used to assess variation) reveal significant diversity even among closely located individuals. Research from Storfosna island, Norway, suggests long-term local adaptation to bark or rock habitats has led to habitat-specific genetic variants, shaping the overall population structure.\nWhile local populations may have limited genetic diversity, populations from different geographic regions show significant genetic differentiation. For example, Antarctic populations of Rusavskia elegans from sites just 5–15 km (3.1–9.3 mi) apart differed by one nucleotide. In contrast, those separated by 660 km (410 mi) showed a 14.2% divergence in their DNA sequences. Similar patterns in other Xanthoria species suggest that, despite limited variation within local populations, long-distance dispersal and genetic drift contribute to regional differentiation and ecological adaptation.\nAt broader spatial scales, X. parietina populations show a pattern of isolation by distance—genetic differences increase with geographic separation. A global genetic study using RAPD-PCR fingerprinting identified just two major genetic clusters worldwide: one in southwestern Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Balearic and Canary Islands) and another spanning Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. The high similarity between Australian/New Zealand samples and those from Europe indicates the species was introduced by humans to the Southern Hemisphere, possibly via grapevine transport or ship ballast stones. A similar human introduction has been suggested for the lichen in the populated Willamette Valley of the western United States, and in Ontario, where it may have arrived on nursery trees.\nThe high genetic diversity observed in X. parietina has several practical implications for its ecology and conservation. This diversity likely supports the species' adaptability to different environments—from coastal rocks to urban trees and polluted areas. High genetic variation within local populations provides material for natural selection, enabling adaptation to changing conditions including pollution levels and climate shifts. The different genetic structures between the fungal and algal partners suggest that X. parietina gains ecological advantages by pairing with locally-adapted algal partners, improving its ability to colonize diverse habitats. From a conservation perspective, this genetic diversity helps predict how the species might respond to environmental changes and identifies potentially important population groups for biodiversity management. The genetic structure also reveals patterns of human-assisted spread, as shown by the similarity between European and Southern Hemisphere populations.\nAlthough X. parietina is homothallic (self-fertile), genetic studies reveal it frequently mates with other individuals. This represents a novel reproductive strategy termed 'unisexuality'—a form of homothallism where individuals of a single mating type can still engage in sexual reproduction with others. Genetic analyses of X. parietina and its algal partner Trebouxia decolorans show contrasting population structures. The fungal component displays high genetic mixing and little structure between populations. In contrast, the algal partner shows clear genetic differences between populations, consistent with its primarily asexual reproduction. This suggests that X. parietina's success across diverse habitats may partly come from its ability to associate with different locally adapted photobionts. When compared to fruticose lichens such as Evernia mesomorpha and Ramalina menziesii, X. parietina shows stronger genetic differences among populations within the same landscape. This indicates that X. parietina has more limited genetic exchange between nearby populations than previously thought, possibly due to habitat specialization.\nMolecular investigations into the mating-type (MAT) loci have further revealed the reproductive strategies within Xanthoria. While X. parietina is homothallic—possessing only a MAT1-2 gene (although truncated)—species such as X. polycarpa are heterothallic, with distinct MAT idiomorphs (different mating-type genetic regions). These differences in mating system structure can significantly affect population genetics, influencing levels of genetic diversity, gene flow, and ultimately speciation processes within the genus.",
    "Pollution tolerance": "Xanthoria parietina is highly resistant to air pollution, including heavy metals, nitrogen compounds, and ozone. Laboratory experiments have shown that it tolerates exposure to air contaminants and bisulfite ions with little or no damage. It is also resistant to heavy metal contamination and nitrogen pollution. The mechanisms underlying this tolerance involve multiple protective systems. The parietin layer in the upper cortex acts as a hydrophobic barrier, reducing the penetration of toxic metal ions into the photobiont cells. Experimental studies have shown that parietin-deficient thalli experience greater physiological stress when exposed to heavy metals. Parietin also contributes to ozone tolerance; fumigation experiments revealed that samples containing parietin recovered photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll integrity more quickly than those without it, suggesting an antioxidant function in addition to its role as a light-screening pigment. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels induced by ozone exposure were significantly higher in parietin-deficient samples, reinforcing its role in oxidative stress mitigation. The hydration state of X. parietina influences its ozone sensitivity. Dry thalli suffer less damage and recover more quickly than hydrated ones, likely because reduced gas exchange limits ozone penetration. This factor helps explain the lichen's resilience in Mediterranean climates, where it often remains desiccated during periods of high ozone pollution.\nBoth symbiotic partners contribute to detoxification within the thallus. The photobiont is particularly vulnerable to metal toxicity due to its delicate photosynthetic machinery but mitigates damage through the synthesis of phytochelatins—sulfur-rich peptides derived from glutathione that bind and sequester metal ions. These compounds serve as a secondary defense when metals penetrate the parietin barrier. The mycobiont also aids metal tolerance through cell wall immobilization of metals and the production of antioxidant compounds. Other protective mechanisms include pH buffering, high potassium content, and antioxidant properties of parietin. The lichen also mounts induced detoxification responses, including conversion of toxic sulfur dioxide to non-toxic sulfate, increased glutathione production, enhanced synthesis of proline and arginine, and improved ROS detoxification. These adaptations help maintain stable physiological functions in polluted environments: its chlorophyll remains intact, photosynthetic activity declines only moderately, cell membranes maintain integrity with minimal electrolyte leakage, and ATP levels remain constant. These characteristics allow X. parietina to persist in polluted environments where many other lichen species decline.",
    "Response to pollution and environmental stress": "Historical records indicate that X. parietina persisted in London despite severe air pollution, even when many other lichens disappeared. Mid-20th century mapping studies revealed that its distribution correlated with areas of moderate sulphur dioxide concentrations, but it was absent from the most polluted zones of central London, suggesting that while resistant to airborne contaminants, it has an upper tolerance limit. However, it is sensitive to certain pollutants, as demonstrated after the Torrey Canyon oil spill, when oil contamination and toxic dispersants caused widespread mortality on coastal rocks. Affected thalli lost their characteristic orange pigmentation, indicating chemical damage that interfered with enzymatic and protein activity, ultimately leading to detachment from the rock surface. The dispersant BP 1002, used during cleanup efforts, was later found to be highly toxic to marine life and coastal lichens. In X. parietina, its surfactant components disrupted algal cell membranes, reducing photosynthetic activity and accelerating thallus deterioration.\nPollution affects both the population structure and development of X. parietina. There has been a decline in population density with increasing pollution levels; one study documented approximately 47 thalli per tree in lightly polluted zones, compared to 12 in moderately polluted areas and 9 in severely polluted regions. In unpolluted environments, the lichen completes its full life cycle, reaching maturity and old age. However, in polluted urban areas, lichen bodies often die before reaching these later developmental stages. Morphological effects of pollution include smaller thalli, fewer and smaller apothecia, and weaker substrate attachment at later developmental stages. Rather than accelerating development under stress, as some plant species do, X. parietina exhibits retarded development of pregenerative individuals and elimination of less tolerant generative individuals. Its pollution tolerance also varies with light availability; optimal conditions appear to be in areas with low pollution and good illumination, where young generative individuals dominate and reproductive capacity is highest.\nThe species also demonstrates high metal tolerance. A key mechanism is the immobilization of toxic metals in the apoplast (the extracellular space between the cell wall and plasma membrane), preventing them from entering living cells. Additionally, it produces protective thiol peptides, increases antioxidant production, and maintains membrane integrity under metal stress. Laboratory studies indicate differential sensitivity to various metals, with its tolerance being higher for cadmium and nickel but lower for copper and mercury. It also shows resilience to pesticide exposure, persisting in untreated gardens but declining in semi-intensive orchards and disappearing in intensively sprayed orchards. These physiological responses to various pollutants make this species valuable for environmental monitoring applications.",
    "Lichenicolous fungi": "Xanthoria parietina hosts a diverse array of lichenicolous fungi—fungi that live on lichens. As of 2017, at least 41 species of lichenicolous fungi have been reported on X. parietina, including both obligate parasites and facultative colonizers. Examples include Athelia arachnoidea, Catillaria nigroclavata, and Capronia suijae. While some of these fungi may be pathogenic, others colonize the lichen without causing obvious damage to the thallus.\nIn some cases, multiple lichenicolous and saprotrophic fungi can form complex communities on decaying thalli of X. parietina. One study in Austria documented ten different fungal species simultaneously colonizing damaged lichen thalli. The most visually apparent was Xanthoriicola physciae, while the dematiaceous hyphomycete Cladosporium macrocarpum was the most abundant colonizer, covering large areas of the thallus and apothecia with dark cottony filaments. This fungus causes visible discoloration and unevenness of the apothecial discs before eventually destroying the lichen structure. Other notable parasites included Lichenoconium xanthoriae, Lichenodiplis poeltii, and Pyrenochaeta xanthoriae. The highly destructive Marchandiomyces aurantiacus forms distinctive pale orange crumbles on the lichen surface, ultimately shrinking the thallus to a bleached, fragile film that clings to the substrate before complete decay.\n\nAmong these, the recently described (2023) fungus Tremella parietinae is found exclusively on X. parietina, where it induces the formation of convex, orange to yellow galls within the hymenium of its apothecia. This fungus is known from several European countries—including Austria, Spain, and Sweden—and likely has a broader distribution wherever its host occurs. Another lichenicolous fungus, Tremella occultixanthoriae, parasitizes X. parietina but develops on the lower surface of the thallus and produces four-celled basidia. Both fungi belong to a broader complex of Tremella species that specialize in infecting Teloschistaceae lichens, often with strict host specificity.\nSome common saprotrophic fungi not typically associated with lichens have also been found colonizing X. parietina. These include Epicoccum nigrum, appearing as dark purple-brown hemispherical heaps on the surface of apothecial discs, and Periconia digitata, which forms distinctive stalked spherical heads resembling tiny pins on the apothecia and thallus. The environmental conditions that trigger such extensive fungal colonization remain unclear, although factors like prolonged snow cover, high rainfall, or other environmental stressors may initially weaken the lichen, making it susceptible to fungal invasion.\nAnother lichenicolous fungus is Arthonia parietinaria, which was long misidentified as Arthonia molendoi or A. epiphyscia. This species forms mat black, dull ascomata that are arranged in large groups of up to 20–30 (sometimes 50) on the thallus surface of X. parietina, including its apothecial margins and hymenia. Unlike A. molendoi (which primarily infects Rusavskia elegans), A. parietinaria appears to be restricted to the X. parietina group and is widespread throughout Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. The fungus acts as a commensal or weakly parasitic species, causing no significant destruction of host tissue outside infection spots, though larger groups of ascomata may cause slight discoloration of the host thallus.\nThe biochemical impact of the lichenicolous fungus Xanthoriicola physciae on its host has been investigated using Raman spectroscopy. This technique revealed that the fungus destroys key photoprotective pigments—such as parietin and carotenoids—that are vital for shielding the lichen from intense sunlight. Additionally, the detection of scytonemin—a pigment typically produced by cyanobacteria and known for UV protection—in the infected tissues implies secondary colonisation by cyanobacteria.",
    "Gastropod interactions and dispersal": "Xanthoria parietina serves as both a food source and shelter for certain gastropods. The snail Balea perversa uses the lichen for shelter and nourishment. Similarly, other gastropods, such as Helicigona lapicida, feed on Xanthoria parietina. This grazing may contribute to lichen dispersal: photobiont cells from X. parietina partially survive passage through the snail's digestive tract, retaining some photosynthetic activity even after digestion. Such survival raises the possibility that snail herbivory could facilitate lichen relichenization—either by recombining surviving symbionts from the same thallus or by mixing photobionts and mycobionts from different individuals in fecal deposits. However, digestion significantly reduces photobiont viability, with photobiont fluorescence (a measure of photosynthetic activity) declining by 41–44% after passage through the snail gut. While some cells remain intact, they often suffer morphological damage (including shrunken chloroplasts and enlarged cell wall-to-membrane distances), leaving it unclear whether surviving photobionts can effectively establish new lichens without viable fungal spores or hyphae.",
    "Microfaunal interactions": "The apothecia of Xanthoria parietina also host microscopic animals. Members of the rotifer genus Philodina have been observed feeding on the lichen's ascospores present on apothecial surfaces. Individual rotifers can accumulate several dozen spores, and when ingesting 20 or more spores, about 15% remain viable and capable of germination after excretion. These findings indicate that rotifers may act as dispersal vectors, dislodging and releasing viable spores in new locations.",
    "Competitive and ecological roles": "Beyond these interactions, Xanthoria parietina often overgrows other epilithic lichens without affecting their photobionts. It also supports microbial communities beneath its thallus, likely benefiting from microhabitats created by its attachment structures. In addition, Xanthoria parietina plays a role in biogeochemical cycling by promoting rock weathering through hyphal penetration and adhesion. Its interactions with minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and muscovite contribute to mineral breakdown, particularly in carbonate-rich substrates.\nFinally, the lichen competes with other foliose lichens. In experimental settings, it showed competitive equivalence with Parmelia caperata but was overgrown by Parmelia saxatilis under some conditions. In three-species mixtures, however, X. parietina often gained a competitive advantage—possibly due to its tolerance for elevated nitrogen levels. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments may allow it to outcompete acidophytic species in habitats influenced by agricultural or atmospheric nitrogen inputs.\nWhen competing with other lichens, X. parietina typically forms codominant relationships rather than completely displacing other species, particularly in early colonization stages. Field studies show that when X. parietina thalli border upon other lichens such as Physcia species, neither distinctly overgrows the other, but rather their marginal lobes intermingle. The frequent co-occurrence of X. parietina with grey-colored Physcia species may represent more than simple cohabitation. Research suggests that during reproduction, fungal spores from X. parietina may engage in a form of reproductive parasitism (a type of symbiosis where a microorganism alters the reproduction of a host) by \"stealing\" algal partners from Physcia lichens, which contain the same algal species. This algal sharing strategy provides a reproductive advantage, as germinating X. parietina fungal spores can bypass the uncertain process of finding compatible free-living algae.\nHowever, the species engages in a long-term ecological succession pattern. Studies tracking lichen communities over five-year periods found that Physcia species (such as P. adscendens and P. caesia) are comparatively short-lived, typically developing and vanishing within about two years, while X. parietina populations persisted throughout. Eventually, in sheltered or humid locations, bryophytes (particularly Orthotrichum species) tend to invade and overgrow lichen-covered surfaces—representing the normal succession pattern in canopy situations. The regenerative capacity of X. parietina allows it to maintain its presence longer than many other lichen species during this successional process, but it is eventually replaced by vigorously growing mosses in most sheltered habitats.",
    "Traditional medicine": "Xanthoria parietina has a long history of use in traditional medicine across several cultures. In Andalucia, Spain, this lichen was known as flor de piedra ('stone flower') or rompepiedra ('stone breaker'). Spanish traditional healers employed it for several purposes: treating menstrual complaints when prepared as a decoction in wine, addressing kidney disorders and toothaches when made into water-based decoctions, and serving as a general analgesic. They also incorporated it into cough syrups along with various plant ingredients.\nIn European traditional medicine during the early modern era, X. parietina was boiled with milk to treat jaundice, often alongside Polycauliona candelaria. This application exemplifies the Doctrine of signatures – a belief system that plants resembling parts of the body could treat ailments of those parts – as the yellow-orange color of the lichen was thought to indicate its efficacy against the yellowing of the skin in jaundice.\nIn Traditional Chinese medicine, it was known as Chinese: shí huáng yī ('stone yellow clothes') and valued for its antibacterial properties. The widespread medicinal use of lichens, including X. parietina, had been mostly abandoned by 1800, and these applications represent historical folk remedies rather than evidence-based treatments.",
    "Dyeing": "Xanthoria parietina has been used as a natural dye source for centuries. Historical evidence indicates that ancient civilizations recognized this lichen's dyeing properties. In a 1934 publication, Reginald Campbell Thompson analyzed ancient Assyrian texts that mention lichens and dyeing. Thompson noted that the \"yellow wall lichen\" was \"affirmed to give a good yellow or orange colour, if fixed with alum\". Thompson's analysis of these ancient tablets suggests that knowledge of using lichens with alum as a mordant existed in ancient Mesopotamia. Alum (a naturally occurring mineral containing aluminium sulfate) was a mordant used with this lichen primarily to fix the dye to fabrics. Thompson notes that \"the discovery of alum was one of the most important events in the history of dyeing.\" X. parietina was valued for its accessibility, growing readily on tree trunks and walls, and its ability to produce consistent yellow to orange hues when properly processed with mordants.\nParietin is responsible for the lichen's dyeing properties, and pure isolated parietin produces the same color characteristics as whole lichen extracts. When processed using different extraction methods and mordants, this lichen yields a diverse range of colors. Extractions in boiling water produce golden-brown, yellow, and caramel hues, whereas 10% ammonia fermentation processes yield purplish-pink, orange, and pink shades. The POD (photo-oxidized) method, which involves exposing the lichen material to sunlight in an alkaline solution over time, can extract blue or purple dyes from X. parietina. \nAlum has proven to be particularly effective as a mordant for X. parietina dyes, allowing the natural colors to develop fully while enhancing their permanence. Mordants function by creating a chemical bridge between the natural dye and the fiber, forming strong bonds that ensure the color's resistance to washing and fading.\nModern research has expanded beyond traditional dyeing applications, focusing on parietin. This hydrophobic compound serves as a natural photoprotective agent for the lichen. Recent studies have explored parietin's potential in nanotechnology, particularly in the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties.",
    "Historical": "In 1888, the French botanist Gaston Bonnier demonstrated early experimental evidence for lichen symbiosis through his work with X. parietina (then called Parmelia parietina). He reported creating artificial lichen thalli by replacing the organism's natural algal partner (Protococcus viridis) with different algae species, including Protococcus botryoides and the filamentous reddish alga Trentepohlia abietina. While his methods foreshadowed modern microbiological techniques and represented a significant step for the time, modern assessments note critical limitations. His algal sources were not truly isolated (coming from other lichen thalli), and his \"synthesized lichens\" only vaguely resembled natural specimens, showing fungal hyphae surrounding algal cells but lacking true lichen morphology.\nIn 1967, Richardson conducted early transplant experiments with X. parietina that helped establish methods for studying lichen adaptability. Using a novel technique of attaching lichen thalli to new substrates with resin glue, the study achieved a 96% survival rate in transplanted specimens. When coastal specimens (var. ectanea) were moved to farm roofs in Oxford, they showed significant morphological changes within 18 months, including increased lobe width from 0.8 mm to 2.4 mm. The study also demonstrated that parietin production could adapt to local conditions within six months, with transplanted specimens eventually matching the pigment levels of native populations. This early research helped establish that while some morphological features remain stable regardless of environment, others show significant plasticity in response to new conditions. The transplantation technique proved valuable for studying both taxonomic relationships and ecological adaptations in lichens, helping lay groundwork for future experimental studies.\nIn 1986, researchers performed the first complete laboratory resynthesis of X. parietina from its separate fungal and algal components. The experiment involved isolating fungal spores and algal cells, growing them separately, and then allowing them to recombine on an agar substrate. After 8–12 months, the symbionts formed new lichen thalli 2–5 mm across, complete with apothecia. While these artificially created lichens showed a similar basic structure to natural specimens, they differed in some aspects, including paler pigmentation and the absence of some characteristic lichen products. This achievement represented a breakthrough in understanding lichen biology, as successful laboratory synthesis of lichens had been a challenge for over a century.",
    "Biomonitoring": "Xanthoria parietina is an effective biomonitor for tracking air pollution trends and heavy metal accumulation over time. A seven-year study in Adriatic Italy measured nine heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, V, Cu, Zn, Fe, Al) in 51 locations, revealing spatial and temporal pollution patterns. During the study, Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe, and Al levels increased, likely due to industrial and vehicular emissions, while Pb levels declined, reflecting the phase-out of leaded gasoline. The study also identified pollution hotspots, with elevated vanadium levels near oil refineries (a marker of fossil fuel combustion) and higher copper and zinc concentrations in urban areas, likely from traffic and industry. Statistical analyses showed that Al, Fe, Cr, and Ni were linked to industrial emissions and resuspended soil dust, while Cd, Zn, Cu, and V were associated with oil refinery activities and long-range pollutant transport. This ability to differentiate pollution sources makes X. parietina a valuable tool for environmental forensics and pollution source attribution.\nIn addition to pollution mapping, X. parietina is used in environmental health risk assessments, identifying areas with persistent heavy metal accumulation that may indicate higher human exposure to airborne contaminants. One advantage of lichen biomonitoring is that it provides a cost-effective alternative to air-quality networks, which require specialized equipment and infrastructure. Because lichens accumulate pollutants over time, they allow for high-density spatial sampling, even in areas lacking automated monitoring stations. This makes X. parietina particularly useful for retrospective pollution assessments and long-term environmental monitoring. Findings from the Adriatic Italy study support its role as a reliable tool for tracking pollution trends, identifying pollutant sources, and informing environmental planning and public health strategies.\nEnvironmental influences on growth rate have important implications for biomonitoring studies that use X. parietina to assess air quality. Because the lichen accumulates pollutants over time, differences in growth rates between populations can affect pollutant load measurements. Thalli in humid, cooler environments may accumulate contaminants at a lower rate than those in drier, warmer habitats simply due to differences in growth and dilution effects. Consequently, lichen-based biomonitoring efforts must consider local climatic conditions to ensure accurate comparisons of atmospheric pollution levels across regions.",
    "Astrobiology and space research": "Xanthoria parietina's extreme resilience has made it a focus of astrobiology and space-exposure research. Lichens are among the most stress-tolerant life forms, and X. parietina, with its strong UV defenses, has been tested for survivability in space and Mars-like conditions. Laboratory experiments simulating outer space conditions (high vacuum, cosmic UV radiation) exposed the lichen to 10–14 days of extreme stress. The lichen survived, remained metabolically active, and resumed growth after treatment, proving its short-term viability in space environments. Laboratory tests have further demonstrated the lichen's extraordinary cold tolerance, with dry samples surviving immersion in liquid nitrogen at temperatures below −182 °C (−295.6 °F).\nBuilding on these findings, X. parietina was tested under simulated Martian conditions in a 2023 study. Samples were exposed for 30 days to low pressure, a CO2-rich atmosphere, extreme temperature shifts, and high UV radiation. The lichen's health was monitored using chlorophyll fluorescence and structural analysis. It survived the full 30 days, retained photosynthetic ability, and maintained structural integrity, though UV-exposed samples showed reduced efficiency and some pigment degradation. Given this resilience, researchers suggested X. parietina as a candidate for long-term space exposure, such as on the International Space Station or satellites.\nA 2024 study further examined X. parietina's physiological resilience under simulated Martian conditions. After 30 days, photosynthetic efficiency dropped by 85% in UV-exposed samples and 46% in non-UV-exposed samples. However, within 24 hours of returning to Earth-like conditions, photosynthesis began recovering, demonstrating X. parietina's ability to repair its photosynthetic system after prolonged extreme exposure.\nRecovery appears to be linked to antioxidant production. Under Mars-like conditions, oxidative stress increased antioxidant levels, protecting against UV and temperature fluctuations. Over 30 days, antioxidant levels declined as the lichen neutralized reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating an adaptive response that supports survival in extreme environments.\nX. parietina minimizes metabolism under extreme conditions. In the Mars simulation study, photosystem II efficiency declined under UV stress but remained active. UV-shielded samples performed better, suggesting that without radiation exposure, X. parietina could survive Mars-like cold and low pressure. Raman spectroscopy revealed carotenoid and parietin degradation after prolonged UV exposure, but enough pigment remained to protect vital cells, leaving the lichen's structure intact.\n\n\nReferences"
