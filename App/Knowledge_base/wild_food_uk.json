    "Average Mushroom height (CM)": "(no data)",
    "Average Cap width (CM)": "5–20",
    "Fruiting Body": "Often forms irregular fruit bodies, the below mentioned description describes the regular, rosette form of the species. Cap 5–20 cm across, nearly flat, roundish to rosette-like, turns irregularly lobe with age; nearby fruit bodies often fused together. Its upper, sterile surface is initially white to off-white, then pink to reddish brown; smooth to slightly hairy ( tomentose ). Margin thin and paler than the rest of the upper surface, bruising reddish brown when handled or damaged. Stem 4–7 cm long and 2–3 cm thick, tapering towards the base, often deeply ‘rooting’.",
    "Pores": "Tubes 5–6 mm long, creamy white. Pores 1–3 per mm (sometimes even wider), irregularly angular to daedaleoid , slightly decurrent ; white, staining pink to reddish if damaged.",
    "Flesh": "Dual-layered ( duplex ), 8–10 mm thick. The upper (external) layer is soft and ochraceous, while the core or inner layer is a bit harder (corky) and more cream in colour.",
    "Habitat": "On all kind of hardwood, often on buried roots, more rarely on conifers. Saprotrophic , causes white-rot, most of all in the roots of deciduous trees. Growing solitary or in smaller groups. Its main fruiting season is Late Summer to Autumn, but it can be found during the whole year.",
    "Possible Confusion": "Young, irregular fruit bodies secrete/oozing red droplets. In this form it can be confused with Devil’s Tooth ( Hydnellum peckii ) and/or Mealy Tooth ( Hydnellum ferrugineum ), but both species can be found exclusively in old conifer forests, near Pine or Spruce, also these species have spines (teeth), not wide pores. The regular fruit bodies might be confused with the rarer Zoned Rosette ( Podoscypha multizonata ), pictured, which also prefers hardwoods, especially Oaks, but Zoned Rosette doesn’t have visible pores. If we look it more carefully it more reminds of a pink to red stained Wood Cauliflower ( Sparassis crispa ) than a Blushing Rosette.",
    "Taste / Smell": "Inedible, taste mild, but it has a strange mushroomy smell (some authors describe the smell as somewhat unpleasant).",
    "Frequency": "Occasional and widespread in the UK.",
    "Spores": "Spore print is white. Spores elliptical, colourless ( hyaline ), and thin walled with oil drops.",
    "Other Facts": "It often forms irregular, aberrant fruit bodies. It could be hemispherical with its pores upside-down, but even if it forms its regular, rosette form, the so-called ‘rosecomb mutation’ is rather common. In mycology, the term ‘rosecomb mutation’ is used when any kind of distortions, lumps or malformations occur on the cap and makes visible the gills or the pores. Its epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name which identifies the species within the genus) – biennis – suggests it is biennial, but it is incorrect, and likely based on the really variable appearance of this species."

  "Amanita sect. Vaginatae": {
    "Description": "From now on we use “Grisettes” as a colloquial term to refer all the ringless Amanita species (Amanitasect.Vaginatae). Their species level determination, based on macroscopic features only, is anything but easy and except for a few characteristic species, rather impossible. Thankfully there are a few features that help to recognise them as one of the Grisettes.All the Grisettes are medium or big size agarics (mushrooms with distinct cap, gills and stem), their cap is smooth (exceptSnakeskin Grisette(Amanita ceciliae) which has thick velar greyish patches on it, and a few other species in this group), margin of their cap is striated, gills are white to cream coloured, there is no ring or skirt around their stem which could be either smooth, covered with a snakeskin-like pattern or with small flakes. Their stem is cylindrical or slightly tapering towards the top of the stem (apex), their volva is saccate (looks like a sac) and very often remains in the soil if you try to pick it.Although they are considered edible, caution must be taken if foraging for this mushroom as it can look similar to aDeathcap(Amanita phalloides) or another toxic member of the genus.",
    "Edibility": "Edible",
    "Common Names": "Grisettes",
    "Scientific Name": "Amanita sect. Vaginatae",
    "Season Start": "Jul",
    "Season End": "Oct",
    "Average Mushroom height (CM)": "8-15",
    "Average Cap width (CM)": "4-12",
    "Cap": "The cap of all Grisettes starts ovate but will flatten out, usually retaining an umbo. The colour of the cap is really variable, from almost pure White to Beige, Brown or Grey, with a darker centre and striations at the edge of the cap in line with the gills below. Most of the Grisettes don’t usually have any remains of the volva sticking to the cap.",
    "Gills": "The gills are generally White, but sometimes they could be Cream coloured too. They are crowded and usually free of the stem although they can be adnexed, (slightly joined to the stem).",
    "Stem": "The colour of the stem is mostly rather similar to the cap’s colour. It is very often smooth, but sometimes it could have a snakeskin pattern on. Commonly cylindrical, but can be tapering slightly towards the apex (top of the stem).",
    "Volva": "Has a sack like volva that can be hidden in the undergrowth.",
    "Flesh": "Thin, white and can become hollow in the stem.",
    "Habitat": "Associated with different broadleaved and coniferous trees, in some locations with small shrubs or herbaceous plants.",
    "Possible Confusion": "The Deathcap ( Amanita phalloides ), pictured, can look similar but has a skirt, this is not however a reliable form of ID as the skirt can be missing or damaged. The Tawny Grisette ( Amanita fulva ) is very similar but is a tan/orange colour. The Orange Grisette ( Amanita crocea ) is an orange colour and is usually larger.",
    "Spore Print": "White. Spherical.",
    "Frequency": "Not common.",
    "Other Facts": "Although Amanita vaginata is called the Grisette, there is no consensus on what exact species we should call Amanita vaginata , so this page depicts the general aspects of close lookalike species in Amanita section Vaginatae . Despite Grisettes being edible we do not recommend them for novices, because they can easily be confused with other Amanitas (incl. toxic species) and most of the Grisettes do not have a remarkable taste so unless you are desperate and 100% sure of the identification they are best left alone."

    "Possible Confusion": "In foraging terms this closely resembles many other deadly Amanita. However the more common Amanita , like the Deathcap ( Amanita phalloides ) or the Destroying Angel ( Amanita virosa ), pictured, all have white forms but have obvious volva and less substantial scales. There are several uncommon Amanita / Saproamanita that are very similar, but again these have either obvious volva, are less robust, or inhabit different habitats.",

    "Other Facts": "The symptoms of Destroying Angel poisoning can start several hours after ingestion with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains and can last for a few days; this is followed by what seems to be a recovery for a few days but ending in death from kidney and liver failure. The main poison, alpha-amanitin, kills liver cells and passes through the kidneys to be recirculated and cause more damage. There are things that can be done to try and mitigate any harm from ingestion of the Destroying Angel while on the way to hospital. Excessive hydration with water can be very helpful as soon as possible. In hospital they can now sometimes treat the poisoning using an extract of milkthistle, if not, dialysis followed by new kidneys and possibly liver is the only option."

Modern DNA studies split Boletus into smaller genus allocating this one in Neoboletus . More recently it came to light that the name “erythropus” had been previously used for a different species of Bolete which makes the name scientifically invalid.  Recent books list it as “ Neoboletus luridiformis ” but “ luridiformis ” isn’t a valid name under scientific rules either, and apparently “ Boletus praestigiator ” was the first valid description of this species. Newer books published after 2017 should be naming it as “ Neoboletus praestigiator “."

    "Stem": "7-11 cm long, 1-3 cm diameter. The stem is yellow to orange with a dark red mesh which turns to yellow at the very top of the stem. When cut down the middle the stem flushes blue at the top fading to pale orange-yellow at the bottom with a wine red area towards the base.",
    "Flesh": "When sliced down the middle the flesh turns from yellow to blue-black instantly but leaves a wine red line between the cap flesh and the top of the pores, there is also usually a wine red region towards the bottom of the sliced stem. This staining fades after a little time. The red line can just be made out in this photo.",
    "Habitat": "Deciduous woodland, particularly Beech and Oak but can sometimes be found in association with conifers.",
    "Possible Confusion": "Many toxic species can be confused with the Lurid Bolete: – The poisonous Oldrose Bolete ( Imperator rhodopurpureus ) has many similarities with the Lurid Bolete but will never have the red line between pores and cap flesh, it is also very rare; – Devil’s Bolete ( Rubroboletus satanas ), pictured, is the most toxic possible confusion. It never has the red line that appears between the cap flesh and the top of the pores of the Lurid Bolete, the flesh has a less intense blueing and it won’t have the vinaceous red flesh at the base of stem. The cap of the Devils Bolete is chalky white but this is less reliable as the cap can fade on older Lurid Boletes; – Bilious Bolete ( Rubroboletus legaliae ) and Ruddy Bolete ( Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus ) have similarities with the Devil’s Bolete above and can be distinguished by the same features pointed. In addition to that the Ruddy Bolete’s flesh only turns blue in the cap and upper stem, never down the whole stem; – The Brawny Bolete ( Imperator torosus ), the Bitter Beech Bolete ( Caloboletus calopus ) and the Rooting Bolete ( Caloboletus radicans ) have yellow pores that turn blue and are never red; While the last two are very bitter and only mildly toxic the first one is quite poisonous.",

    "Other Facts": "The scientific name of the species has an interesting origin. There are two slightly different, but still connected explanations of the origin of the name of the genus, Byssomerulius . Every sources agrees on Byssomerulius is a result of merging two words, ‘ Byssos ‘ + ‘ Merulius ‘. Robert M. Hallock (PhD) in his book, A Mushroom Word Guide : Etymology, PronounciationAild food Uk & Meaning of over 1.500 Words says, the Greek word ‘Byssos’ or ‘Βύσσος’ refers to ‘a fine yellow flax’. Hallock forgot to mention that in Greek, ‘ byssos ‘ can also mean a fine linen made of byssos -flax, and that linen was also yellowish. Pat O’Reilly, the author of the book, Fascinated by Fungi , says “the genus name, comes via Greek from the Latin byssus , meaning fine silk-like cloth and is probably a reference to the many fine maze-like ridges that pattern the surface of these fungi rather like interlocking jigsaw pieces, and -merulius is the name (origin obscure) of the closely-related Merulius crust fungus genus.” We aren’t find the exact etymology of the word ‘ Merulius ‘, but the word ‘ meruloid ‘ means: wrinkled with uneven ridges. The epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name) ‘ corium ‘ comes from Latin, and it means ‘leather’."

It contains a thin gelatinous layer and the immature, cage-like miniature fruit body (the individual arms are attached at their apex). Once hatched, the witch’s egg fruitbody emerges and leaves the remnants of the egg as a volva . Fruit body is formed of 4–8 finger-like arms, connected with a thick, short stem-like structure. The individual arms are 3–7 cm tall, pinkish to bright red (like red meat flesh), covered with a glutinous layer that contains the spores. Flesh is soft, spongy, fragile, hollowed and somewhat pinkish.",

    "Spores": "The spores are trapped into a mucous layer covering the inner wall of the octopus’ arms. Spore print is olive-brown, but you can’t really make a spore print. Spores elongated-ellipsoid, smooth, thick-walled.",
    "Other Facts": "Described from Tasmania, Australia; It is native to Australia, New Zealand and southern areas of Africa. Like all the stinkhorns, it starts its life in an egg-like structure, which is commonly called a witch’s egg (in this stage it is considered edible). Once it has hatched it becomes an octopus-like strange looking mushroom. It doesn’t have a long shelf-life, a few days after it hatched its egg, it collapses and rots into the substrate . Same as all the stinkhorns, this species distributes its spores with the help of insects. The mushroom attracts the insects with its rotting meat-like odour. When the insects land on the inner surface of the mushroom, its spores (trapped into a mucous layer on the inner wall of the individual arms of the ‘octopus’) attach to their feet and in this way they will leave the spores behind wherever they landing after this encounter."

If you cook with these when the caps are on the turn, they will dye everything you cook with them black. If the caps have started to open when you pick them you will have to eat them that day. Young ones may last 48 hours in the fridge if you are lucky. You can make younger ones last a bit longer in the fridge if you remove the stem before chilling; this seems to delay the transformation into ink. You can also make some very good ink from them. To do this mix the inkcap ink with a little water and some cloves and heat it. This process will help fix the ink and stop it from fading or running when you use it.

The mushroom grows exclusively on Birch naturally but can be artificially introduced to other types of tree. It has long been known that the Birch Polypore has medicinal uses, it has been used as a tonic for the immune system, as an antiseptic to clean wounds and promote healing, a plaster that is microporus, antifungal and antiseptic and probably was used by Bronze Age man to get rid of parasitic worms. In 1991 Austrian hikers in the Tyrol region of the Italian Alps discovered a frozen corpse. When this was later examined it turned out to be a 5300 year old mummy that they named Ötzi. Ötzi had some Birch Polypore on a leather thong around his neck, he also had a parasitic intestinal worm called a Whipworm which can be cured with polyporenic acid which is one of the chemicals present in the Birch Polypore. Another possible use of the fungus by Bronze Age man was as a very good tinder that can be started with a weak spark or used to transport fire as the fungus can smoulder for a long time and can be used to take to the next camp or destination and get a fire lit quickly without the long and laborious task of lighting a fire by friction. Birch trees contain betulinic acid which has many health benefits, there are also other chemicals in the Birch Polypore that are beneficial for being healthy. With modern research it is becoming clear that the Birch Polypore is an important mushroom to look into, tests have been carried out and so far found the following."

The genus name ‘ Ganoderma ‘ is made of 2 different Greek words, ganos or γανος means ‘brightness’, derma or δερμα means ‘skin’, so altogether means ‘shiny or bright skin’, while the epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) ‘ lucidum ‘ comes from the Latin word ‘ lucidus ‘ which means bright, shiny, etc. Ganoderma lucidum was first described by William Curtis, a British mycologist in Flora Londinensis in 1781 as Boletus lucidus . Until recently we thought that Ganoderma lucidum is the same species as the Reishi, the highly praised medicinal mushroom from Asia, but we were wrong. Our Ganoderma lucidu m is a European species, not native to Asia. The legendary Reishi or Lingzhi ( Ganoderma sichuanense , syn: Ganoderma lingzhi ) is a similar looking, but completely different species (they aren’t even in the same clade within the genus). However, because of the huge amount of money being invested to promote the health benefits of Reishi, this well-known scientific fact won’t reach the marketing department/team of food supplement manufacturers for a long time…"

    "Fruiting Body": "Unlike most of the Earthstars, it starts as an onion-shaped (mostly spherical with a small, round nodule on top) closed sac (2–4 cm in diameter) above the soil surface, and eventually opens up. The ‘head’ or spore sac ( endoperidium ) is more or less spherical, thin-walled, greyish brown and smooth. It is sitting on the inner surface of the arms ( exoperidium ) without having any visible supportive stem-like structure ( sessile ). Spore exit ( peristom ) is raised-conical, fibrous without ridges, and surrounded by a small boundary-halo. Often covered with brown spore powder. Spore-bearing tissue of the ‘head’, called the ‘ gleba ‘ is creamy and solid (cheese-like) when immature, powdery and brown when the spores matured. Outer layer ( exoperidium ) cracks up to 5–8 arms. The inner surface of the arms brake off and form a saucer or collar-like structure (hence the common English name). It is more or less creamy in the inside, darker brownish on the outside. The arms bend round underneath the fruitbody and lift it up from the soil.",
    "Habitat": "Grows on nutrient rich soil, both under deciduous and coniferous trees, preferably on slopes, much less likely on flat areas. Saprotrophic.",
    "Possible Confusion": "It can be confused with other Earthstars, such as Rufous Earthstar ( Geastrum rufescens ), pictured, Geastrum saccatum , or Sessile Earthstar ( Geastrum fimbriatum ), especially if we found an immature (unopened) fruit body. The peristom of Rufous Earthstar ( Geastrum rufescens , pictured) doesn’t have a boundary-halo, and when its arms crack, they are reddening in the cracks. Geastrum saccatum is much smaller than the Collared Earthstar ( Geastrum michelianum ), about half of its size, and its arms rather flatten on the soil than crawling under and lift up the fruit body. In a recent phylogeny study by Zamora JC et al (2014) proved that G. michelianum and G. saccatum are two different species from two different sections of genus Geastrum . The peristom of Sessile Earthstar ( Geastrum fimbriatum ) doesn’t have a boundary-halo, also, the inner layer of its arms doesn’t brake off and form a collar, not to mention that it is smaller than the Collared Earthstar ( Geastrum michelianum ).",

    "Spores": "Spore print is brown. Spores spherical, densely covered with spiny warts, light brown.",
    "Other Facts": "The scientific name of the genus comes from ancient Greek, where ‘ geo ‘ means Earth, ‘ aster ‘ means Star. The epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) refers to the mostly visible three layers of the mature fruit body: the spherical head or spore sac ( endoperidium ), the broken off inner layer of the arms, and the arms ( exoperidium ). Until recently it was called as Geastrum triplex , however, the original Geastrum triplex was described from a Tropical deciduous forest on Java, Indonesia, and has a different DNA to our European Geastrum “ triplex “, so we tend to use its former name, Geastrum michelianum , which – in our opinion – should be the valid scientific name of the European species."

    "Fruiting Body": "Annual, 10–30 wide and 5–8(10) cm thick, shelf-like. Soft and spongy when young, dry and brittle with age. Widely attached to its substrate, without having a stem ( sessile ). Upper surface (skin): Rough, hairy ( hirsute , hispid ), zonate to azonate. Variable in colours from bright orangish red to reddish brown when young, dark brown to black with age. Margin obtuse, concolorous with the upper surface.",
    "Pores": "Tubes 5–20 mm long, soft, yellowish brown to dark brown when young, dark brown to almost black and brittle with age. Pores 1–3 per mm (sometimes even wider), angular, yellow to olive-yellow when young, turning dark rusty brown to almost black with age. It bruises brown if cut or otherwise damaged. Often secreting very pale yellow to amber coloured droplets (this phenomenon is called: guttation).",
    "Flesh": "Up to 5 cm thick. Azonate, yellowish, soft, hygrophanous, spongy to fleshy when young, dark brown to black, brittle when dry. Turns black with KOH.",
    "Habitat": "Growing on living deciduous broadleaf trees. Its most common hosts are probably Ash and Oak in the UK, but commonly found on fruit-bearing trees in gardens, parklands, old orchards and forests. Necrotrophic parasite, causing white-rot of sapwood and the crack of the wood along the annual ring.",
    "Possible Confusion": "It is almost unmistakable when young, but when its is dry, there are a few possible confusions. Chaga, the sterile conk ( sclerotium ) of Inonotus obliquus , pictured, is rather rare in England, more common in Scotland, and regardless it may grow on a few hardwood genera, it is more common on Birch . If you crack it or cut it, the inside of Chaga is reddish brown, but without having any tubes or pores. The old and dry fruit body of Dyer’s Mazegill ( Phaeolus schweinitzii ) might look similar, but it is a root parasitic species of conifers (rarely of broadleaf, deciduous trees too) with a noticeable stem.",

    "Flesh": "White not changing colour when cut, but later slowly reddening. It can often be found already stained red where eaten by slugs.",
    "Habitat": "On calcareous soil under broad-leaved trees, particularly Beech .",
    "Possible Confusion": "Since it appears at the end of Spring and early Summer it may be confused with a late flushing St George’s Mushroom ( Calocybe gambosa ), pictured. However the St. George’s Mushroom doesn’t stain red, its cap doesn’t have radial fibres, its spores are whitish cream and its smell is distinctive.",
    "Spore Print": "Dull brown. Ellipsoid.",
    "Taste / Smell": "The smell is strong and pungent but hard to describe. It is sometimes compared to honey, fruit or perfumed soap. Although the flesh is said to taste sweet, we don’t recommend tasting this mushroom due to its toxicity.",
    "Frequency": "Common in Southern England where suitable habitat (woodland on chalky soil) occurs, reappearing every year in the same woodland. Rare in other parts of the country.",
    "Other Facts": "The Deadly Fibrecap is considered the most toxic of all Fibrecaps, but all species of this genus are suspected of being poisonous and should all be avoided. The Fibrecaps are identified by the radial fibres in the cap, the fibrous stem and the dull brown spore print. Most are little brown mushrooms and quickly dismissed by foragers."

We aren’t aware of its existence in the UK, but there is an ongoing research which wishes to determine the number of native Laetiporus species in the UK. Laetiporus sulphureus f. imbricatus (T. Niemelä and A. Bernicchia cosider it as an independent species under the name Laetiporus imbricatus ) looks just a bit paler than our Laetiporus sulphureus . It is native to the Mediterranean region, where it grows on Almond trees.",
    "Spore Print": "White. Ellipsoid to broadly ovate.",
    "Taste / Smell": "Mushroomy and said to taste like chicken to some, it has the same texture as chicken and is good in stews as a veggie ‘meat’.

Some people can have an allergic reaction so only a small amount should be tried when first tasting this mushroom. Also see Other Facts below for notes on Yew.",
    "Frequency": "Fairly common.",
    "Other Facts": "One of the most common hosts for this fungus is the very poisonous Yew tree, and it is often said that the fungus will absorb the toxic alkaloids (Taxine and Taxane) from the tree. Some mycologists have said that this is unlikely, and some foragers have reported eating it from yew repeated times without any issue. However we have also had reports of severe gastric upsets after consumption from Yew. In any case, the toxic alkaloids found in Yew are very resilient and can be found even on dead wood and fallen needles. Therefore specimens collected from Yew should be very carefully inspected, trimmed and cleaned thoroughly to remove any needles or wood debris trapped inside. At this point we cannot recommend collecting Chicken of the Woods from Yew as safe. It is a common fungus and you should be able to find it in other trees."

    "Habitat": "Open woods and pastures, often among ferns, on verges between roads and woods or fields.",
    "Possible Confusion": "When young this mushroom looks very similar to some of the deadly amanitas, due to the fact it emerges from a sack-like structure and can have a similar looking cap. The confusion with other lepiotas which are smaller can be ignored if the mushroom cap is over twelve centimetres in diametre, when mature nothing that looks similar is anywhere near as big apart from the Shaggy Parasol ( Chlorophyllum rhacodes ), pictured. The shaggy does not grow quite as large and is slightly off-white to dusty in colour, the stem has no snakeskin effect and the flesh stains red when cut.

    "Other Facts": "Parasols can be found alone but generally they are found in rings or sometimes troops. As stated above, nothing else really gets this big apart from Shaggy Parasols. You can often spot them from quite a distance along the edges of fields, woods and roads. Parasols are generally whiter than their cousins the Shaggy Parasols, but the Shaggys do have a white variant, so apart from the fact Parasols get marginally bigger than shaggys, the way to tell the difference is that the stem of the shaggy parasol will blush reddish when bruised or cut and never has the snakeskin effect of the true Parasol. The Parasol is the better of the two mushrooms to cook with as there are some who suffer slight gastic abnormalities after eating Shaggy Parasols. Parasols have a great mushroomy flavour, but but don’t be fooled by their starting size as they shrink a lot during cooking."

Also the edge of the cap of C. rivulosa mainly stays in-turned even when the mushroom has opened out.

    "Possible Confusion": "The False Morel ( Gyromitra esculenta ), pictured, but this is more lobed or brain-like rather than the pitted and honeycomb like cap of the morel. The False Morel also differs in not having a completely hollow cap.

The Common Morel ( Morchella vulgaris ) is very closely related to the Morel. It is usually more grey in colour specially when young. The ridges of the cap are thicker and the pits are more irregular and labyrinthic in shape. The Morel has thinner edges and polygonal shaped pits. Intermediate forms exist that may be hard to differentiate at the very young or very mature stage. The “Morels” are a large group (technically called a clade or section ) of very similar species, and mycologists still  haven’t established exactly how many species exist, their distribution, and how they differ from each other.

The colours range from dark olive brown to darker brown or black.",
    "Stem": "White to cream, bruising ochre or brown with age. Usually vertically furrowed on the outside. The inside is hollow and wrinkled. At the top the stem widens to join the edge of the cap, forming a hollow depression, and clearly dividing the stem from the walls of the cap.

It is also known to appear in burned forests, disturbed grounds and occasionally under Apple trees. Closely related similar looking species of Morels also appear in short grass near coniferous trees in calcareous soil or coastal dunes.",

The False Morel also differs in not having a completely hollow cap. The Stinkhorn ( Phallus impudicus ) can also look similar to those who are unfamiliar with it, but the strong foul smell quickly denounces its identity. It appears in Summer and Autumn when Morels are no longer around. The Morel ( Morchella esculenta ) or Common Morel ( Morchella vulgaris ) can look similar, even in colour, but usually the ridges on the cap of the Black Morel have fairly regular vertical lines unlike the randomly arranged honeycomb of the other two.

Turf Mottlegill ( Panaeolus fimicola ) shares its habitat with Brown Mottlegill, however, it fruits a bit earlier and it is slightly larger. It has rather similar coloured cap and stem too, but the edge of its gills are white and its spores are red-brown in Melzer’s reagent (under microscope). Dewdrop Mottlegill ( Panaeolus acuminatus ) is similar in size and grows on the same habitat as Brown Mottlegill, however it has black spores, the gills mottled with black and becoming entirely black with maturation, but the easiest way to separate the two species is to check the gills in wet weather. Dewdrop Mottlegill often have water droplets on/around the gills which turns black because of the spores, hence its common name. Banded Mottlegill ( Panaeolus cinctulus ) is growing out of cow or horse manure (incl. middens). It is slightly bigger than Dewdrop Mottlegill, and it is more reddish-brown than its relative. According to D. Arora, it contains psilocybin which – if it is a correct info – makes it as a Class A drug in the UK, however, this information cannot be confirmed by UK authors.",

However, there is no evidence about the presence of psilocybin in this species, even in traces. It is also possible that it was confused with one of its toxic lookalikes. There are some reports about it might be toxic to children if consumed in large enough quantities, but eating raw mushrooms may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms even if the mushroom itself is not toxic at all, so we stick to the international (European) classification and consider this species as inedible only."

Can also look like a Puffball , Earthball , pictured, or Amanita egg when in the egg stage, but Puffballs are soft, spongy and pure white inside, Earthballs are tough and usually purple or black inside, Amanitas at the egg stage will have a small fruiting body inside, but it is not surrounded by slime and again the smell should help you avoid any confusion.",
    "Spore Print": "Pale yellow. Oblong. As the spores are mixed in the olive grey gleba, it is not possible to do a spore print with this mushroom.",
    "Taste / Smell": "At the egg stage, this mushroom is reported as edible. The tough cuticle in the egg does taste a bit like radish, but we don’t eat this mushroom as the smell is putrid and most unappetizing.",
    "Frequency": "Common.",
    "Other Facts": "This mushroom has been reported to have aphrodisiac qualities, but this is purely down to it’s phallic look, rather than anything scientific.

Some authors treat Cerioporus varius , syn: Polyporus varius as a separate species, but we treat them as the same species as Blackfoot Polypore, because both of our references, A. Bernicchia and S.P. Gorjón, also A.E. Bessette et al. treats them as synonyms, and both of them refer them as C. leptocephalus . Blackfoot Polypore has even smaller cap (6–8 cm across) and smaller pores (7–9 pores per mm), also, it grows mostly on various hardwoods (with the preference of Beech ), rarely on conifers.",

    "Description": "This common Autumn mushroom has been illegal to pick, prepare, eat or sell since 2005 as they are now considered a class A drug. Liberty Caps contain the active ingredients psilocybin and psilocin, which can cause hallucinations and in some cases, nausea or vomiting.",

    "Average Mushroom height (CM)": "5",
    "Average Cap width (CM)": "1",
    "Cap": "The cap can vary in shape, size and colour. When young it is translucent brown and will stay brown if the weather is wet, if the cap dries it becomes buff/white/grey/silver but almost always has a darker to black bottom edge. The cap has a ‘nipple’ which can be quite pronounced or barely present and the bottom edge always tucks under. When fresh, the cap has a translucent covering that, if you are very careful, can be peeled away.",
    "Gills": "The gills start light grey/black, are mottled and have a lighter edge but become very dark purple/black as the spores are released.",
    "Stem": "The stem is off white, slightly shaggy on close inspection, can have a blueish base with mycelium still joined. The stem usually curves and bends and is rarely straight.",
    "Flesh": "Has very thin flesh.",
    "Habitat": "More common in fields, moors and grassland where animals are grazed but can be found in lawns and in parks.",
    "Possible Confusion": "Some of the Mottlegills from the genus Panaeolus can look similar but none have both a pronounced umbo and a bent and curving stem. Some of the grassland bonnets ( Mycena sp.) might look similar with age too, however their striated cap might be a relatively easy giveaway.",
    "Spore Print": "Dark purple. Ellipsoid.",
    "Frequency": "Common.",
    "Other Facts": "Magic Mushrooms are currently treated the same as heroin or LSD and are class A drugs but very recently (Oct 2021) the government was looking to change this due to the apparent benefits from treating certain illnesses with psilocybin and psilocin, the active components of Magic Mushrooms. These include chronic depression and PTSD. The research is ongoing but they do seem to be proving useful in the medical field."

The Stinking Brittlegill gives different reaction to KOH (doesn’t react to KOH on the flesh whereas the Least Stinking Brittlegill will stain blue), and has bigger warts (up to 1.4 μm) on the spores than its lookalike. Camembert Brittlegill ( Russula amoenolens ) has a spermatic smell, and an unpleasantly hot taste.",

Stereum hirsutum can be parasited by a mycoparasitic species, called Naematelia aurantia , syn: Tremella aurantia , which is commonly called as Golden Ear in the US. Naematelia aurantia is a close relatives of Naematelia aurantialba , syn: Tremella aurantialba , the “real” Golden Ear and it is considered an edible and medicinal mushroom in China, and cultivated in large quantities. The story behind this confusion of common names is quite simple. N. aurantialba is only native to China, while N. aurantia has a much broader distribution, it is native to Europe, North & South America, Asia (incl. China) and Australia. Both species parasiting the mycelium of Hairy Curtain Crust, and the two species had been separated only in 1990 (until this point both were known as Golden Ear).

There is a single study back from 1981 which reported these substances from the fruit body of S. caerulea , but it seems to be just a mistake, because none of the later analytical studies were able to find any of these even in traces. This mushroom will also cause gastric upsets so is not a safe mushroom for consumption."

Its skin is whitish cream and covered in long, shiny, silky-hairy fibres. Cap margin is often in-rolled, sometimes hairy ( fibrillose ). Can have parts of the veil/egg remaining on the cap.",
    "Gills": "Crowded, free, white when young, turning pink with maturity. The edge of the gills are lightly scalloped.",
    "Stem": "7–15 cm tall, 1–2 cm wide, cylindrical, tapering towards the apex, bulbous at base. Creamy white, same as the cap, shiny-scaly, powdery at the apex. It emerges from a persistent, bag-like volva.",
    "Volva": "Thick and membranous. Whitish before hatching, turns ochre to even brownish with age, its surface often cracked, and once hatched, it remains around the stem base as a persistent bag.",
    "Habitat": "Saprobic on dead or weak, but living hardwood, preferably Elm, Beech , Oak, Sycamore and other Maples, most often be found growing from knots or damage to living trees. Growing solitary or in small groups in parks or woodlands.",
    "Possible Confusion": "The Destroying Angel ( Amanita virosa ) pictured, is similar but has a skirt, a smooth rather than shaggy cap although both can have bits of veil still attached and it grows in soil, not on wood. The Stubble Rosegill ( Volvopluteus gloiocephalus ), is similar but again has a smooth, not hairy cap and grows in soil not on wood.",
    "Spore Print": "Pink (to brown). Ellipsoid, smooth and thick walled.",
    "Taste / Smell": "It has a faint radish-like smell and a mild and radish-like taste. It is edible, some say excellent but due the uncommon nature of this mushroom, we consider it off the menu.",
    "Frequency": "Uncommon."

  "Volvopluteus gloiocephalus": {
    "Description": "A large mushroom on nutrient rich, often disturbed habitats. It has shiny skin, distinct volva (often under the soil’s surface) and a radish-like smell. It has no ring but because of the high risk of misidentifying this mushroom and possible heavily contaminated soil, we suggest just leave where you found it.",

    "Fruiting Body": "Annual, sessile (growing without a stem), broadly attached to the host tree. 3–8 cm long, 2–5 cm wide, 1.5–2 cm thick, semi-circular; numerous fruit bodies often overlapping and (ef)fused. Sterile (upper) surface finely hairy ( tomentose ) at first, but the fine hairs often flattened down to the surface ( appressed ) to the point when it feels almost smooth ( glabr ous ). Once flattened, often concentrically zonate. Pale yellow brown to reddish brown, darkens to tobacco brown to almost black with age. Margin rounded, sometimes radially wrinkled.",
    "Pores": "Tubes 3–8 mm long, rusty brown to amber brown with a thin, silvery covering layer ( pruina ). Pores 2–4 per mm, round-angular to irregularly rounded, covered with tiny hairs (which only can be observed with a magnifying lens from a certain angle), silvery grey to yellowish, yellow brown, bruises darker rusty brown.",
    "Flesh": "Up to 1 cm thick, fairly zonate. Soft at first, then corky to woody, becoming fragile at the end. Yellowish brown at first, then turns dark brown.",
    "Habitat": "Almost always on dying or dead wood of Alder ( Alnus ), rarely on Birch ( Betula ) or other broadleaves. Necrotrophic parasite (some authors say saprotrophic on wood), causes white-rot.",
    "Possible Confusion": "It is hard to confuse with other species. Oak Bracket ( Pseudoinonotus dryadeus ) might look similar for some, but it is a root parasitic species, mostly growing around the roots of an Oak ( Quercus ) or a Chestnut ( Castanea ). It is a common species and much larger than Alder Bracket. Mensularia nodulosa , pictured, grows on Beech ( Fagus ), and it is really rarely recorded and has a NT – Near Threatened status on the Red Data List (2006).",
    "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Smell and taste not distinctive.",
    "Frequency": "Widespread and common on the British Isles.",
    "Spores": "Spore print whitish to pale yellowish. Spores ellipsoid to almost spherical ( subglobose ), colourless ( hyaline ) to yellowish, thick-walled, smooth and dextrinoid (turning reddish-brown in Melzer’s reagent).",
    "Other Facts": "Like many current or former Inonotus species, Alder Bracket often guttates (secrets sticky droplets without any sort of cell damage). The droplets are translucent to pale amber at beginning, darkening with age and might leave some drop marks on the sterile upper surface. The epithet (2nd part of the scientific name) ‘ radiata ‘ means ‘having radiating markings’. It is more common in Northern Europe, much less frequent in the Mediterranean region. It is widespread and common in Northeastern, North Central and Southern regions of the US."

    "Fruiting Body": "What we can see is not the fruit body of the species, but a communal fruit body (called a stroma ). It hosts hundreds of individual fruit bodies. The stroma is really variable by shape and size, it could be 7–8 cm tall and 1–3 cm wide. It is upright, compressed, needle-like to more or less branching, like a stag’s antler, (hence the common English name). It is initially greyish, covered with fine white-grey dust ( conidia ), turning dark, almost black with maturation. The stroma’s surface is covered with black, sub-spherical, pimple-like tiny fruit bodies (called perithecia ) which can hardly be detected by the naked eye. The lower, sterile, stem-like supportive part of the stroma is black and more or less hairy.",
    "Flesh": "Really thin, white and more or less tough.",
    "Habitat": "Saprotrophic on dead wood of deciduous trees, including fallen branches, and occasionally can be seen on conifer stumps too. Might be acting as weak parasite on ailing, injured or stressed trees. It is a really common species in any sort of woodlands, urban parks, etc.",
    "Possible Confusion": "It is really hard to confuse with anything else, but some authors says it might or could be confused with Beechmast Candlesnuff ( Xylaria carpophila ), pictured, so let’s look at the difference between these two species: Candlesnuff Fungus is growing on the dead wood of hardwood trees, (also, rarely, on heavily decayed conifer stumps), while Beechmast Candlesnuff is growing on decaying beechmast. Candlesnuff Fungus forks like the antler of a stag, while Beechmast Candlesnuff is not forked at all.",
    "Taste / Smell": "Inedible. Smell and taste not distinctive.",
    "Frequency": "Common and widespread.",
    "Spores": "Spore print is black. Sexual spores are produced by the asci (singular: ascus ), hence called ascospores . Bean-shaped, some might be flattened on one side, smooth, dark brown with 1–2 oil-droplets ( guttule ) when young. Asexual spores ( conidiospores ) are smaller than sexual spores; they are smooth, ellipsoidal and colourless ( hyaline ).",
    "Other Facts": "The species is a subject of pharmacological researches. Some of its biologically active compounds, such as xylarial A and B showed moderate cytotoxic activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Its pyrone-derivatives, (such as xylarone and 8,9-dehydroxylarone), which were isolated from the submerged culture of X. hypoxylon strain A27-94, showed cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell-lines in vitro ."

It is initially off white to greyish, covered with fine grey dust ( conidia ), turning dark brown to almost black with maturation. The stroma ‘s surface is covered with tiny pores (the mouth/exit of individual, flask-shaped fruit bodies, called perithecia ) which cannot be detected by the naked eye.",
    "Flesh": "White and more or less tough. Taste and smell indistinctive. Traditionally it is not considered edible in any part of the world.",
    "Habitat": "Saprotrophic on dead woods of various hardwoods (deciduous trees), but preferably Beech , grows out of fallen woods, the roots or stumps of dead trees. It causes a so-called soft-rot (instead of breaking down cellulose and causing brown-rot, or breaking down lignin and causing white-rot, it is breaking down the glucans which act as a binding agent “or glue” between these two).",
    "Possible Confusion": "It could be confused with other Xylaria species, most of all the much skinnier Dead Moll’s Fingers ( Xylaria longipes ).",
    "Frequency": "It is very common and widespread in the UK.",
    "Spores": "Sexual spores are produced by the asci (singular: ascus ), hence called ascospores . Spindle or banana-shaped, some might be flattened on one side, smooth, dark brown with mostly only one oil-droplet ( guttule ). Asexual spores ( conidiospores ) are smaller than sexual spores, they are smooth, ellipsoidal and colourless ( hyaline ).",
    "Other Facts": "There is a study by Debnath S et al (2018) which claims that Xylaria polymorpha (and the other four Xylaria species in India) contains amatoxins or phallotoxins (unfortunately the study doesn’t elaborate which one), also, their study doesn’t mention the actual amatoxin and/or phallotoxin content of the fruit bodies of each species they wrote about. Mentioning the amatoxin and/or phallotoxin content of Xylaria polymorha without mentioning the actual toxin content of the fruit bodies has almost zero scientific relevance. Xylaria species aren’t considered edible in any part of the world and the fact that some started using them as spooky crisps during Halloween won’t change this. We don’t advice anybody to eat Xylaria species, but we are also against fearmongering which might increase the mycophobia (the irrational fear of mushrooms and other fungal species)."
