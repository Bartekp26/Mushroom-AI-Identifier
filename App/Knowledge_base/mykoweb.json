    "Edibility": "Unknown.",
    "Comments": "Befitting its species name, Coprinus calyptratus has a distinctive, often star-shaped cap patch, a remnant of the universal veil. This feature plus a stipe with a marginate bulb help to separate it from a closely related cousin, Coprinus comatus. Small specimens of the latter are superficially similar, but can be distinguished by a veil, that breaks up into erect cap scales, the presence of an annulus, and microscopically by spores that are smaller, usually with a central germ pore. Another close relative of Coprinus calyptratus , is C. xerophilus. This smallish species, like Coprinus calyptratus , is found in dry habitats, particularly in the Great Basin, and has a well-developed cap veil. The veil, however, is whitish, not buff to tan, often fragments, and tends to occupy a greater portion of the cap surface. Both species have relatively large spores with eccentric germ pores."

Coprinellus flocculosus differs in its scattered fruitings, usually on sawdust, woodchips, straw etc. It is also has a different type of veil, consisting of felt-like fragments rather than the clumps of globose cells which give rise to the glistening appearance of C. micaceus. Additionally, remnants of the universal veil in Coprinellus flocculosus may form a thin collar at the base of the stipe. Another species similar to Coprinellus flocculosus is Coprinellus domesticus. It differs in having a cap with a more tawny-brown disc, a somewhat granular appearing veil, and a preference for fruiting on hardwood logs and stumps. Microscopically it is distinguished by thick-walled rather than thin-walled velar cells, and smaller spores with a central, not eccentric germ pore."

Traditionally these mushrooms were lumped locally under the name Hygrophorus conicus. We have followed the modern trend which recognizes several species in the group and places them in the genus Hygrocybe. Ironically, Hygrocybe conica , the best known of the species, may not be the most common member of the group in California (and the true H. conica , a European species, probably does not occure in California). It is recognized by a viscid, red/orange conic-cap with a moist, but not viscid stipe, and tendency for all parts to blacken. Hygrocybe acutoconica is similar but only the stipe base blackens. Hygrocybe singeri is distinguished by a viscid stipe, while Hygrocybe olivaceoniger is distinguished by a yellowish-green to olive, not red-orange colored fruiting body. Finally, Hygrocybe nigrescens , is separated from Hygrocybe conica by its slightly larger size, redder, more rounded umbonate cap, and association with oaks."

In contrast, Dacrymyces chrysospermus occurs on decorticated conifer wood and is not associated with Stereum species. Despite their similar appearance, the two taxa are actually distantly related as evidenced by their very different microscopic characters.

    "Lamellae": "Gills free, close, moderately broad, white becoming cream, staining pink to vinaceous with concentrated sulfuric acid.",
    "Stipe": "Stipe 4-18 cm long, 1-3 cm thick, equal to tapering to an enlarged, sometimes bulbous base, usually solid but the apex sometimes stuffed; surface finely striate at the apex, otherwise smooth or with scattered, flattened small scales, white to pale yellowish; flesh white, firm, unchanging; partial veil membranous, cream-colored to tinged like the cap, the upper surface striate, lower surface slightly pubescent, forming a pendulous, superior annulus; volva membranous, thin, white, sac-like, usually erect from the stipe.",
    "Spores": "Spores 7-12 x 6-10 µm, ovoid to elliptical, amyloid; spore print white.",
    "Habitat": "Solitary, scattered, to gregarious under coast liveoak ( Quercus agrifolia ), occasionally with other oaks and ornamental hardwoods; fruiting sporadically during the summer months in watered areas or from fog drip along the coast; common from early fall to mid-winter.",
    "Edibility": "Deadly poisonous! A. phalloides contains both phallotoxins and amanitins. It is the amanitins that are responsible for the poisonings in humans. Amanitins are cyclic octapeptides that stop protein synthesis in the cells they encounter. All human organs are affected, but damage to the liver is most severe and liver failure is primarily responsible for the death of A. phalloides victims. Symptoms usually appear 8-12 hours after ingestion. Death occurs in 7-10 days in 10-15% of patients.",
    "Comments": "A large, handsome mushroom, the death cap is often very abundant under oaks in the San Francisco Bay Area, especially in warm, wet years. It is also becoming increasingly abundant in other areas of California where oaks are common. Because of its toxicity, it should be one of the first mushrooms learned. Fortunately, Amanita phalloides is distinctive and with experience, easily identified. Important field characters are the smooth, yellowish-green to yellowish-brown cap, sometimes with a thin, appressed white universal veil patch, usually non-striate cap margin, free, cream-colored gills, normally solid, not hollow stipe, pendulous annulus, and thin, white, membranous, sac-like volva. The Death Cap is found widely in coastal areas as well as inland at low elevations. A rare, white form of this mushroom, var. alba resembling the Death Angel of the Eastern U.S ( Amanita bisporigera ), also occurs in the California. Another lethal Amanita found locally is Amanita ocreata. Cream-colored, and similar in appearance to the Death Cap, it fruits under coast liveoak ( Quercus agrifolia ) during the spring."

    "Comments": "Xylaria hypoxylon can be found year round in California on downed wood. Fruiting bodies are blackish, thin, wiry and branched with white tips. The white tips consist of masses of asexual spores (conidia). As the fruiting body matures, it thickens, becomes all black, and sexual (ascospores) are produced in embedded perithecia. The latter form tiny pores on the surface of the fruiting body. Critical study of this species is needed in California, as there may be a number of species of Xylaria masquerading under this name, or the species may be extremely variable."

Other grey California Tricholomas include Tricholoma virgatum , also with a dry cap, but the cap is conic, and has appressed fibrils, rather than scales. Tricholoma nigrum , reported from coastal Oregon and Washington under pines and Douglas fir is similarly colored but the cap usually has appressed fibrils, if squamulose, only at the disc; Tricholoma atroviolaceum differs with an evenly colored dark grey, violaceus tinged fibrillose-squamulose cap and dark grey gills in age; Tricholoma griseoviolacum found under oaks and Tricholoma portentosum , typically with pines, can be distinguished by greyish purple viscid caps. In the coastal zone, two smaller grey Tricholomas with dry caps are found, Tricholoma terreum , synonymized here with Tricholoma myomyces var. cystidiotum and Tricholoma scalpturatum. Tricholoma terreum , a pine dwelling species, has a uniformly dark grey fibrillose squamulose cap, pallid only at the edge of the margin, and greyish, not whitish gills; Tricholoma scalpturatum , is similar to T. terreum , but is paler and grows typically under oaks. In the Sierra Nevada, a toxic look-alike of Tricholoma pardinum is T. venenatum. Similar in stature, its cap fibrils and squamules are light brown, not grey."

    "Edibility": "Said to be edible when young, but with local experience lacking, not recommended.",
    "Comments": "This puffball is inevitably described as one of the least attractive of all fungi. However, it can be interesting to section immature sporocarps to view the distinctive sac-like peridioles. At maturity, the peridioles breakdown to form the masses of spores which make this fungus unpleasant to collect. While ignored by most amateur collectors, it's worth noting that it finds use in Forestry because of its ability to form mycorrhizae with a variety of conifer seedlings, and by artists, who use it as a source for dyes."

It should be compared with three other conifer inhabiting Laccarias: L. amethysteo-occidentalis , L. bicolor , and L. noblis. Laccaria amethysteo-occidentalis is easily distinguished when fresh by a violaceus brown cap, violaceus gills, and lilac-colored mycelium at the base of the stipe. Laccaria bicolor is similar to L. amethysteo-occidentalis with vinaceous purple gills and lilac colored mycelium (when fresh) at the base of the stipe, but the unexposed cap is pinkish brown, not purple brown. Laccaria nobilis is a large, robust species found mostly from Mendocino county northward associated with Sitka spruce. It has a distinctly scaly reddish brown to orange brown cap, a scaly, concolorous, subclavate stipe and when fresh, lilac mycelium at the base of the stipe. Two other Laccarias worthy of note are L. fraterna and L. laccata var. pallidifolia. Laccaria fraterna , an introduced species associated with Eucalyptus and related species, is recognized by its diminutive size, a reddish brown cap and two spored basidia. Laccaria laccat a var. pallidifolia , common in the San Francisco Bay Area under oaks, occasionally with pines, is recognized by an orange brown, soon buff colored cap, pinkish flesh colored gills, and a finely striate stipe with whitish mycelium at the base. Microscopically its spores are subglobose with relatively long spines."

The cap is buff, tawny to brownish, covered with small dark scales, often with raised tips. A whitish, decurrent pore layer and central to eccentric stipe are also helpful fieldmarks. Fruiting bodies of Polyporus tuberaster are unusual in that they develop from an underground blackish potato-like tuber called a sclerotium, thought to be a resting stage or storage structure. Apocryphal stories aside, the blackish potato-like tubers are not edible, because of a tough texture and embedded dirt. Polyporus tuberaster is occasionally found on downed wood. Whether a mycelial connection exists from these fruitings to a buried sclerotium is unknown. Polyporus tuberaster can be confused with Polyporus squamosus , a similar but larger, strictly wood-dwelling species that has caps with coarser scales but these typically lack erect or tufted tips. Additionally a sclerotium is not produced.

    "Comments": "The name \"Match-stick Fungus,\" aptly describes this diminutive Ascomycete with a yellow-orange cap and slender, translucent stipe. Its fruiting preference, along the edges of marshes, and brightly-colored cap are distinctive, and differentiates it from other western Mitrulas. Mitrula paludosa of Europe is very similar, but probably does not occur in the United States According to Redhead (1977), it is distinguished by slightly wider spores. Ascomycetes often found fruiting with Mitrula elegans include Sclerotinia veratri , Cudoniella clavus , and various Mollisia species."

We originally believed our collections to be Gymnopilus aeruginosus because of the green stains, but have concluded that overall they are a bettter match for G. luteofolius, especially the the veil, cap color, and cap flesh characters. In Gymnopilus luteofolius the veil is fibrillose-membranous and the cap flesh whitish to vinaceous-purple while in G. aeruginosus the veil is merely fibrillose and the cap flesh tends to be tinged green. A look-alike species for Gymnopilus luteofolius is Tricholomopsis rutilans. It is similarly colored, also grows on wood, but can be distinguished by a white spore print and the lack of a veil."

This is among the smallest of California coral fungi. It is recognized by a slender, usually unbranched, cream-buff fruiting body. Macrotyphula juncea is somewhat similar but grows on the leaves of tanbark oak ( Lithocarpus densiflora ) and redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ).

    "Comments": "This robust bolete has a brown cap, reticulate stipe, and pale-colored pores, features that could lead to confusion with Boletus edulis (king bolete) and Boletus regineus (queen bolete). These favorites of pot hunters, however, do not bruise brown, although they may darken with age, and produce olive-brown rather than pinkish-brown spore prints. Tylopilus indecisus should be compared with Tylopilus porphyrosporus , a blackish-brown bolete found regularly in coastal forests north of San Francisco. Although similar in stature, it lacks the stipe reticulations characteristic of Tylopilus indecisus , and has the unusual property of discoloring wax-paper bluish-green. It's interesting to speculate the reason for Charles Peck's choice of the epithet \"indecisus\" for this bolete. It's possible that he was referring to the strong discoloring of the exterior surface compared to the relatively weak color changes of the cap and stipe context."

Microscopically the absence of pleurocystidia and smooth rather than nodulose spores are important characters. Other reddish-hued Inocybes s.l. include Inocybe pudica , a diminutive species with a glabrous, whitish cap that in age becomes tinged pinkish-red; Inocybe godeyi , also small and white, reddening with age, but with a fibrillose cap, Inocybe fraudans (= I. pyriodora ), with an ochre, fibrillose cap, occasionally red-tinged and strong odor of rotting pears or spicy-like as in matsutake, and Inocybe oblectabilis with a glabrous, reddish-brown to pinkish-brown cap and nodulose spores. Excluding the above, Inosperma adaequatum also bears a resemblance to several vinaceous-colored waxy caps, Hygrophorus erubescens , Hygrophorus purpurascens , and Hygrophorus russula.

Its strong farinaceous odor, though not definitive, is a helpful identifying character, as is its occurrence under oaks. A look-alike, Tricholoma terreum var. cystidiotum tends to occur more under conifers, especially pines ( Pinus spp.) in the San Francisco Bay Area. It differs in a more uniformly greyish-black, fibrillose cap, lacks the farinaceous odor of T. scalpturatum , and microscopically has a hypodermium of inflated cells. Other small greyish Tricholomas include T. cingulatum , an uncommon greyish, fibrillose cap species that occurs with willow ( Salix spp.). It is distinguished by a well-developed white cottony ring. A final member of the small, greyish clan is Tricholoma moseri. It is a montane species found under conifers most commonly in spring near melting snowbanks.

    "Edibility": "Probably edible, but there is insufficient local experience to recommend it. It is listed as edible by some authors, poisonous by others.",
    "Comments": "Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is recognized by an orange to orange-brown, finely tomentose, thin-fleshed cap, brightly colored, dichotomously branched, decurrent gills and white spores. It is often abundant in Bay Area parks, where wood chips are used as mulch, less so in natural woodlandsThe common name suggests confusion with Cantharellus cibarius , but the yellow chanterelle is much fleshier, has blunt ridges rather than true gills, a smooth, not tomentose cap surface, and is terrestrial, not lignicolous. Omphalotus olivascens , the Jack O'Lantern fungus, a toxic species, is also sometimes mistaken for Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca. It, however, is also more robust, is colored yellowish-olive rather than orange to orange-brown, and has gills that lack the characteristic forked branching pattern."

We have used Mueller's 1991 monograph which relies heavily on microscopic features to identify these collections. Laccaria laccata var. pallidifolia is characterized by an orange-brown, sometimes striate cap, which fades to buff in age, and has round, spiny, nonamyloid spores. A close relative, Laccaria laccata var. laccata , has ellipsoid spores, but according to Mueller is uncommon in the U.S. and may not occur locally. We have documented a small reddish-brown, two-spored species, Laccaria fraterna , which occurs primarily under introduced trees, e.g. Eucalyptus and Acacia."

Additional fieldmarks include a cottony-floccose exoperidium that develops stellate scales and flat warts, and a crater-like apical opening in age. A varietal form, Lycoperdon utriforme var. hungaricum lacks a pseudostipe and subglebal tissues. Lycoperdon utriforme can be confused with several medium to large grassland species such as Calvatia pachyderma , Calvatia cyathiformis f. fragilis , and Calvatia booniana. Calvatia pachyderma is a softball or larger sized, globose puffball that differs with a thick, rind-like peridium and lacks a subgleba. Calvatia cyathiformis f. fragilis is a medium-sized turbinate-shaped puffball differentiated by a glabrous (except for areolate patches) exoperidium and purplish gleba. Calvatia booniana , California's largest puffball, is recognized by a compressed globose shape, lack of a pseudostipe, and exoperidium of broad flat polygonal scales and warts. It is rarely found along the coastal California, occurring more commonly in montane meadows and in the sagebrush country of the eastern Sierra."

Characteristic of this species is a fragile, sheathing type volva that at maturity typically crumbles leaving patches on the lower stipe and a short collar-like cup at the base. Similar in appearance and sometimes confused with Amanita protecta are A. vaginata , A. pachycolea , and A. constricta. Differences in the nature of the universal veil help to differentiate these species. In Amanita vaginata the cap typically lacks universal veil patches while the volva is membranous, sac-like, not fragmenting as in A. protecta. Amanita pachycolea is similar to A. vaginata , but usually larger, more robust, with a browner cap and a relatively thick membranous, sac-like volva that tends to discolor rusty-brown. Most likely to be confused with Amanita protecta is A. constricta. It also has a greyish-brown cap with veil patches, and an adherent type volva, but the apical or limb portion of the stipe flares conspicuously from the stipe."

Another ringed species, Psathyrella ellenae var. yubaensis , is smaller, up to 4.0 cm broad, and has a membranous, non-striate ring. It fruits during the spring at mid to higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada. Also similar is Psathyrella barrowsii , known from under aspens ( Populus tremulloides ) in New Mexico and Colorado. Like Psathyrella longistriata it has a brownish, hygrophanous cap and a well developed annulus, but the cap lacks whitish fibrils, striations on the margin as well as on the ring."

    "Edibility": "Edible and choice. Buttons are usually prepared fresh while large specimens are typically dried. Like many members of the bolete group, fruiting bodies of Boletus edulis are frequently colonized with fly larva making it difficult sometimes to find edible specimens.",
    "Comments": "Boletus edulis is distinguished from other members of the bolete group by a combination of characters: substantial size, a smooth to wrinkled brown to reddish-brown cap surface, drab white pores becoming yellowish olive in age, a usually club-shape stipe with distinctive white reticulations at the apex, mild taste, and absence of color changes. A close relative is Boletus regineus (Queen bolete) which differs in having a darker cap with a whitish wash when young, and occurs with mixed hardwoods as opposed to pines."

    "Edibility": "Probably edible, but the viscid, debris incrusted, soon putrescent, often larva infested fruiting bodies should deter all but the desperate.",
    "Comments": "Suillus quiescens is a relatively recently described species of slippery jack. In the San Francsico Bay area it occurs mostly under Monterey pine where it has been mistaken for Suillus brevipes which is not surprising as the two have similar viscid brownish caps and tend to lack glandular stipe dots. Suillus quiescens , however, is typically larger and more robust with a subtly different colored cap and stipe. When young, the cap is paler than S. brevipes , becoming unevenly liver brown, dark reddish brown to pinkish brown, frequently with a pallid margin. In comparison, the cap of Suillus brevipes is more uniformly dark reddish brown fading to cinnamon brown. Additional distinguishing characters are a yellowish stipe apex in Suillus quiescens versus white in Suillus brevipes ; finally, only Suillus quiescens occasionally exhibits greenish splotches or spots on older caps. Interestingly, Suillus quiescens was first described from Santa Cruz Island in southern California under Bishop pine. It is now known to occur with Bishop and Monterey pines along the California coast and probably occurs with other pines as well, including those in the Sierra. In the San Francisco Bay area, Suillus quiescens is less common than Suillus pungens and Suillus fuscotomentosus , two other pine dwelling slippery jacks. The latter species are easily distinguished by stipes with well-developed glandular dots. See those descriptions for more information."

    "Edibility": "Edible when young and the gleba still white, but see Comments.",
    "Comments": "A striking and beautiful puffball, Calvatia sculpta is named for the large, recurved pyramidal warts that decorate its surface. In older specimens, the distinctive hooked warts may flatten leading to confusion with Calbovista subsculpta. The latter can be differentiated by a more rounded shape, a root-like extension into the soil, and warts that have a matted-tomentose surface, not terraced as in Calvatia sculpta. Both species occur at mid to higher elevations of the Sierras and Coast Range in the spring with Calbovista subsculpta being the more common. As noted by Arora (1986), Calvatia sculpta bears a superficial resemblance to Amanita magniverrucata , a possibly toxic, white Amanita with large pyramidal cap warts that occurs along the coast. These unrelated fungi fruit at different times of year at very different elevations, thus the risk of misidentification is low. Still inexperienced collectors considering Calvatia sculpta for the table, especially in the Coast Range, should section young specimens longitudinally to rule out the possibility of an embryonic Amanita."

It can, however, be distinguished from the true chanterelle, Cantharellus californicus (and the other chanterelles in the genus Cantharellus ), by a combination of characters: Cantharellus has ridges rather than true gills, never develops the olive tones of the Jack O'Lantern, and grows in oak duff, not on rotting wood. Omphalotus olivascens is interesting in that the fruiting bodies are luminescent, at least when fresh, though to appreciate this quality requires sitting for many minutes in a completely dark room before the greenish glow becomes visible.

A number of terrestrial polypores are similar. These include Polyporus tuberaster whose funnel-shaped, ochre-brown caps are squamulose, not tomentose, and Albatrellus species, which can be distinguished by pores that never become labyrinthoid, microscopically by the lack of chlamydospores, and a mycorrhizal habit. Phaeolus schweinitizii , which also sometimes forms \"rosettes\" on the ground, is generally larger, has mustard-olive pores nearing maturity, dark-brown when senescent, and saprobic on conifer roots or stumps, not hardwoods. Fresh, young specimens of Abortiporous biennis sometims exude red droplets, suggestive of Hydnellum pecki. The latter, however, is a tooth fungus."

In our area, other common species which form rings or arcs include Clitocybe nuda (Blewit), Agaricus campestris (Field Mushroom), A. arvensis (Horse Mushroom), Stropharia ambigua and several species of coral mushrooms. Like many Marasmius species, dried specimens of the Fairy Ring mushroom have the unusual ability to revive when moistened. A toxic species that somewhat resembles Marasmius oreades , and which can also form fairy rings, is Clitocybe dealbata. It has a white to greyish-white, umbo-less cap, closely-spaced, slightly decurrent gills, but is uncommon in the S. F. Bay Area.

    "Comments": "Amanita vaginata is part of a complex of grey to brown-capped Amanitas that are found in the coastal forests of California. Besides Amanita vaginata , the group includes Amanita constricta , Amanita pachycolea , and Amanita protecta. All have striate caps, lack a partial veil/annulus, and have inamyloid spores. Smallest of the group is Amanita vaginata which is characterized by a greyish cap, evanescent, white, universal veil cap patches that discolor pale ochre, and a volva that flares gradually from the stipe. Amanita constricta differs slightly in cap color, more brown to grey-brown, with universal veil cap patches that typically discolor rust-brown; more significantly, the volva of Amanita constricta , as the species name suggests, is appressed tightly to the stipe, with only the margin flaring. Amanita pachycolea is a large, robust species with a conspicuously striate, brown cap. An important fieldmark is a universal veil which is thicker than either of the above species, flaring from the base, and discoloring rust-brown. Finally Amanita protecta , differs from all of the above in having a cottony-membranous, sheathing, not flaring universal veil that at maturity crumbles leaving scaly patches on the lower portion of the stipe and often a short collar-like volva at the base. Although Amanita is known for its toxic, sometimes lethal species, members of the A. vaginata complex in California (except for A. protecta for which there is little record) are thought to be edible. None, however, are generally considered \"choice,\" and thus are seldom eaten. As is always the case with Amanita species, only the most experienced collectors should consider them for the table."

The reality is less sinister, though not entirely pleasant either. The pinkish-red color and fetid odor presumably imitates decaying flesh, thus attracting flies. Like bees drawn to flowers, the flies unwittingly spread the species by picking up bits of the dark-olive spore-containing gleba. Clathrus archeri is native to Australia and Tasmania, apparently finding its way to California via bamboo nursery stock. Although a saprophyte and seemingly unspecific in substrate requirements, not just bamboo, it has not spread widely, and is known currently in California only from Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. A close cousin, Clathrus ruber is found commonly in wood chips in urban areas. It is spectacular in its own right, producing a pinkish-red, hollow, basket-shaped structure, the interior lined with malodorous gleba"

    "Comments": "This Calvatia is unusual for its purplish-grey spores a character that distinguishes it from all other members of the genus in California which have olive to brown spores. Though distinctive, it should be compared with Scleroderma species, commonly known as \"earthballs,\" some of which are poisonous. Scleroderma species also have purplish spores which can be spinose but differ in possessing a thick, leathery peridium, and microscopically by the lack of a capillitium. Additionally the genus is mycorrhizal, thus is associated with host trees and shrubs, while puffballs like Calvatia species are believed to be saprobic and are not so restricted. Calvatia cyathiformis f. fragilis is morphologically variable, sometimes possessing a pseudostipe, sometimes not, or intermediate between the two. Because of this, authors have differed in the taxonomic treatment of these \"morphs,\" some considering the non-pseudostipe form a distinct species, Calvatia fragilis while others relegating it to simply a form of Calvatia cyathiformis. In coastal California, specimens mostly lack a pseudostipe but intermediates also occur, thus we have treated this purple-spored Calvatia as a form of Calvatia cyathiformis."

The young caps are yellowish-brown to olivaceous brown but become reddish brown in age, while the gills are yellowish in youth, dark orange at maturity. For many years it has been confused with Cortinarius cinnamomeus. Both species have brownish caps at maturity, but C. cinnamomeus has orange gills when young, while those of C. croceus are yellowish. Other species that mimic Cortinarius croceus with olivaceous caps and yellowish to olivaceous gills when young are not so easily distinguished.

The caps are usually faintly-zoned cap with appressed fibrils, in certain light sometimes appear to glisten. Coltricia perennis , found in the Sierra Nevada and elsewhere, differs in having a more distinctly-zoned cap, and a matted-tomentose surface. Compared to Coltricia cinnamomea , the cap colors are more muted--cinnamon-brown, tan, ochre to greyish. Additionally the tube layer of Coltricia perennis tends to be more decurrent than in C. cinnamomea. For look-alikes, see \"Comments\" under Coltricia perennis."

    "Comments": "This diminutive Tricholoma is recognized by a dark-grey to almost blackish, squamulose cap when young with contrasting pale margin and sparse cortina-like veil. The species epithet refers to this species's distinctive hypodermium of inflated cells. It was first described as Tricholoma myomyces var. cystidiotum , a name previously used here. Recent research, however, has concluded that T. myomyces is conspecific with Tricholoma terreum an older name and thus is a synonym. The result is that var. cystidiotum has been transferred to Tricholoma terreum. Besides Tricholoma terreum var. cystidiotum , several other small Tricholoma species occur in California. A common often oak-dwelling species in the San Francisco Bay area is Tricholoma scalpturatum. It is recognized by a strong farinaceous odor, a character lacking in T. terreum var. cystidiotum and a paler fibrillose-squamulose cap. Tricholoma cingulatum , a willow ( Salix spp.) associated species with a pale grey fibrillose cap, is distinguished by a cottony white ring. A third Tricholoma , T. moseri , is found in montane regions and fruits in the spring near melting snowbanks. Its small size, a grey-brown appressed fibrillose-squamulose cap, mild odor, lack of a partial veil, and relatively large spores are fieldmarks."

Fieldmarks of Agaricus moronii include a stocky stature, tendency to discolor tawny-brown, not merely yellow, and chocolate-brown free gills. Agaricus sylvicola is very similar but has a less dramatic bruising reaction, more yellowish than tawny, a normal rather than stocky stature, and slightly smaller spores. It is possible that Agaricus moronii and Agaricus silvicola represent a single polymorphic species or a species complex. Further study is needed to resolve this question."

    "Comments": "Melanophyllum haematospermum is a rare, small brown mushroom with striking pinkish-vinaceous gills and a distinctive granulose cap decorated with marginal veil fragments. Like Agaricus , a distant relative, the gills are free and a partial veil is present. However, the spores are olive-grey when fresh (brown when dry) not purple-brown as in Agaricus. The olive spore color is suggestive of Chlorophyllum molybdites , while the granulose to powdery cap hints of a relationship with Cystoderma. Both genera like Melanophyllum belong in the family Agaricaceae. Melanophyllum haematospermum should be compared with a number of unrelated mushrooms with pinkish to vinaceous gills. These include some diminutive members of Pluteus , Dermocybe , Entoloma , Psathyrella , Hygrocybe , Tubaria , and Agaricus. All of these can be distinguished by attached gills except for Pluteus , which lacks a partial veil and Agaricus which does not have a granulose cap."

Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished by their differing types of basidia rather than asci. Ascocoryne sarcoides occurs in two forms. An anamorph stage is known as Coryne sarcoides , producing asexual, i.e. conidia spores, and a sexual stage producing ascospores. From limited study it appears that the anamorphic stage occurs early in development as fused clubbed to cerebriform masses, while the sexual stage occurs at maturity as the fruiting body becomes repand."

It would also be possible to confuse Agaricus smithianus with Agaricus perobscurus.

Xeromphalina species, however, can be separated by their lignicolous habit, and dark, thin stipes, often with orange-brown hairs at the base. The primary difference between Omphalina and Rickenella is microscopic, the former lacking pileocystidia, but present in Rickenella , and the reason the cap sometimes appears pruinose with a hand-lens.

If it occurs in the Bay Area it is rare as it is not among the herbarium collections at San Francisco State University. Helvella elastica is another look-alike but can be distinguished by less steeply peaked saddle-lobes, a margin which does not curl over the fertile surface when young, and a glabrous, not hairy, sterile, lower surface."

Its robust stature and reticulate stipe sometimes cause confusion with three other local boletes: Butyriboletus querciregius , Boletus edulis and Boletus aereus. Butyriboletus querciregius is similar but has a pinkish to red cap and also grows with oaks. Boletus edulis , the King Bolete, also has a differently colored cap: buff, tan-brown to chestnut-brown, pale pores when young which never bruise blue, and is found mostly with pines. Boletus regineus , the queen bolete is an occasionally encountered bolete that is associated with hardwoods. It has a dark-brown to almost blackish cap when young, a more or less equal stipe at maturity, and like Boletus edulis , does not bruise blue. All of these species have a mild taste and are edible."

Several Omphalina spp. (sensu lato) are similar, but can be separated by their different fruiting habits, i.e. on soil or in mossy areas. Arrhenia epichysium is sometimes confused with Lichenomphalia umbellifera , traditionally known as Omphalina ericetorum or Gerronema ericetorum. It also occurs occasionally on well decayed wood, but differs in a pale-brown to yellowish-brown, not grey to grey-brown cap. Additionally, as suggested by the genus name, it is actually a lichenized fungus, i.e. forms a symbiotic relationship with an alga. Evidence of this association can sometimes be seen as clumps of algae at the base of the stipe."

Gyromitra esculenta and Gyromitra infula are similar, but more erect species. The former has a lobed, wrinkled cap at maturity, while the latter has a lobed, wavy cap. Though easily recognized, at least in California, Gyromitra montana is part of a confusing species complex. See Weber (1988) for a discussion of the taxonomic difficulties. An example is the closely related and almost indistinguishable, Gyromitra gigas , separated by slight microscopic differences. In Gyromitra gigas , the size of the ornamentation on the spore ends (apiculi) is said by some authors to be 1-2 microns larger, than that of G. montana. If these differences are not significant, then Gyromitra montana would be a synonym of G. gigas. A molecular study is needed to help clarify this situation."

The two species are often confused but can be distinguished by cap color, fruiting habit, and spore size. The cap of Gomphidius glutinosus is purplish-grey to purplish-brown while that of G. oregonensis is lavender-brown, pinkish-brown to salmon-pink. Both species develop blackish cap spots in age. A helpful field character is the tendency of Gomphidius glutinosus to fruit singly, while G. oregonensis in well-rooted clusters. Spore size also separates the two. The spores of Gomphidius glutinosus are distinctly larger, 15-19 microns long versus 11-14 microns for Gomphidius oregonensis."

    "Comments": "Coprinopsis friesii , is a small, grass-inhabiting mushroom recognized in youth by an obtuse-conic, striate, often radially torn cap. Remnants of a universal veil in the form of pallid flat scales decorate the cap, which in age becomes upturned and slightly deliquescent. Size and an ephemeral fruiting habit explain why this sometimes common mushroom is seldom collected. Fruiting bodies develop at night, shriveling away soon after dawn. Coprinopsis friesii should be compared with Parasola plicatilis and Parasola leiocephala. This species pair differs from Coprinopsis friesii in having larger, non-ornamented, convex caps with intact margins and spores that are heart-shaped to pentagonal in face-view. Other small grass-loving species that occur with Coprinopsis friesii include Panaeolus foenisecii and Agrocybe pediades. The former is a larger, brownish, convex-capped, non-deliquescent mushroom with a decurved, non-revolute margin, while Agrocybe pediades is a small, cream to tan-brown mushroom, the cap convex to plane, and like Panaeolus foenisecii , does not deliquesce."

    "Comments": "Apioperdon pyriforme is a new name for what has been known as Lycoperdon pyriforme , a puffball familiar to mushroom hunters for its tendency to fruit in dense clusters on lignicolous substrates. The name change stems from a 2017 DNA study that indicates, that despite appearances, Lycoperdon pyriforme does not belong in Lycoperdon. Interestingly, the study confirms what many mycologists have long suspected, that Lycoperdon pyriforme is an outlier in the genus because of its lignicolous habit plus micromorphological differences such as smooth rather than typically ornamented spores, a capillitium that lacks pores, a dense, white cellular rather than loculate subgleba, and conspicuous basal white rhizomorphs. These differences aside, Apioperdon pyriforme does resembles several Lycoperdon species, and should be compared carefully when fruiting in lignin rich soils. These species include Lycoperdon perlatum , L. umbrinum , and L. molle. Lycoperdon perlatum sometimes fruits in clusters, but the exoperidium has conical spines, which when shed, leave circular scars on the endoperium; Lycoperdon umbrinum is a sooty-brown, finely ornamented puffball that fruits solitary to scattered, with a loculate, grey-brown subgleba; Lycoperdon molle is dull brown puffball that also fruits scattered or in small groups, has a loculate subgleba, its most distinctive character, coarsely warted spores. None of these have the thick, white rhizomorphs characteristic of Apioperdon pyriforme."

    "Comments": "Lycoperdon molle is a small to medium-sized, pear-shaped puffball recognized in age by a greyish-brownish to brown exoperidium composed of fine granules and short, often grouped spines. Microscopically it is distinguished by distinctly warted spores, the ornamentation clearly visible at 400X, and the presence of sterigmal fragments in mounts. Lycoperdon molle is sometimes confused with L. perlatum , L. umbrinum, and Apioperdon pyriforme. The most common of the three, Lycoperdon perlatum , differs in an exoperidum composed of conical-shaped, non-convergent spines of two lengths. When shed, the larger spines leave characteristic round scars on the underlying endoperidium, a useful fieldmark. A second species, Apioperdon pyriforme , is unusual among puffballs in having a preference for lignicolous substrates. Identifying characters include a brownish granular, not spinulose exoperidum, a dense white subgleba, stringy white rhizomorphs at the base of the pseudostipe, and a tendency to fruit in large clusters. Also similar is Lycoperdon umbrinum. In California, Lycoperdon umbrinum is a blackish puffball found in mixed hardwood-conifer woods. It can be differentiated by a finer-textured, darker-colored exoperdium which is discontinuous at maturity, i.e. interspersed between the minute, blackish spines, a cream-yellow to brassy-colored endoperidium can be seen with a hand lens."

Typical of secotioid development, the greyish cap often remains closed at maturity, the salmon colored stipe is usually reduced, and the âgillsâ are crumpled. These features in combination with a tendency to develop underground, are believed to be adaptations to often dry conditions during the critical fruiting period and are part of an ecological trend seen in other mushroom groups in the Sierra Nevada. Chroogomphus albipes is also interesting as it appears to form an association with a species of Rhizopogon. Alexander Smith, in describing Brauniellula nancyae , a synonym of Chroogomphus albipes , observed that it often fruits in close proximity with Rhizopogon roseolus (syn. R. rubescens ). These observations from Idaho, have not been documented for California but if so, they mirror similar associations in California for other Chroogomphus and Gomphidius species with the related genus Suillus."

    "Comments": "Pithya cupressina is a small, orange cup fungus found on decaying litter of cypress relatives and redwood. Unlike some cup fungi, it is seldom found in the open, but fruits in deep shade or on partially buried duff, a likely reason for why it is seldom collected. Pithya vulgaris is similar but larger. According to the literature it occurs on needles of Abies (fir), Picea (spruce), and Pinus (pine). Compare with Cheilymenia species which occur mostly on dung; Scutellinia species differ in having long, marginal hairs; Aleuria aurantia typically is larger, cupulate, and terrestrial; Caloscypha fulgens is also larger, cupulate and terrestrial, but in addition tends to discolor bluish with age and handling."

The remarkable transformation from a purple-tinged \"egg\" to a mature, malodorous stinkhorn takes only a few days, but more than enough time for flies attracted by the odor to carry away the spore-embedded slime. Novice collectors sometimes confuse this stinkhorn for a morel, a mistake they're unlikely to repeat, once they examine it closely. In California, Phallus hadriani is most commonly found in parks and sandy areas where its lilac-colored egg stage could conjure up thoughts of misplaced Easter eggs. For homeowners, however, who unexpectedly find it in their garden, the beauty of the egg stage is outweighed by its foetid odor making it an unwelcome guest."

Its defining characters, best seen with a hand lens, include gills that are reduced to anastomosing folds and a rudimentary eccentric stipe. A helpful field mark is the tendency of caps to develop bluish-black spots in age or sometimes becoming greenish or blueish overall. Microscopically, the unusual triangular to pyramidal shaped spores are useful in confirming an identification. Metacampanella subdendrophora is sometimes confused with Marasmiellus candidus which also has a white striate-sulcate cap, and also occurs on blackberry canes. The latter, however, is larger, the caps up to 2.5 cm broad, and often develop pinkish tones. Additionally, the stipe is usually central in attachment and better developed. Crepidotus species likewise bear a resemblance, but have true, typically closely spaced gills and ochre-brown spores.

    "Comments": "Russula queletii is recognized in the San Francisco Bay Area by a cap that is dark vinaceous purple to almost blackish at the disc when young, fading in age to vinaceous purple with a paler margin. Cream-colored gills in age, a stipe that is usually flushed pinkish purple, a weak to moderately acrid taste, and cream-colored, non-reticulate spores also help to define the species. As is true of several California Russulas with European names, it is unclear whether our local version is in fact the same. Further study is needed to determine its taxonomic status. Complicating matters are a number of reddish purple-capped Russulas that occur in the state. Of these, the most conspicuous is Russula xerampelina , the âshrimp Russula,â a larger and more robust species, named for its distinctive seafood odor. It has a broader ecological range found under hardwood as well as conifers along the coast and in the Sierra Nevada. The cap is similar in color, but the blushed stipe yellows with handling, turns greyish to black with FeSO 4, and has a mild taste. Another look-alike, Russula placita is found along the north coast in mixed hardwood-conifer woods. It has a reddish brown to purple cap, also a pinkish-purple flushed stipe and acrid taste, but differs in possessing partially to completely reticulate spores. Russula atroviolacea , as the name suggests, has a purple violet cap. It has a strong acrid taste, but a whitish stipe. Cohabiting with Russula queletii under pines and typically more abundant is Russula sanguinea. It sports a bright red to strawberry red cap that fades to pallid shades in age, a blushed reddish stipe, and a strong acrid taste. Less common but also found in this habitat is Russula californiensis. A look-alike of Russula sanguinea and sometimes confused with it, it has a similar but paler cap color that shows an underlying cream-colored background even when fresh. A whitish stipe also helps to separate the two."

It is most easily recognized in youth when the unexpanded cap is covered with a universal veil of sugar-like or mealy granules and marginal hairs. An unpleasant, often fleeting odor, is also characteristic. With maturity, most of the cap hairs disappear which can cause confusion with Coprinopsis ephemeroides and Coprinopsis cordisporus , two species that also have granulose caps. Coprinopsis ephemeroides differs in possessing a pale-yellow cap disc and thin annulus. Coprinopsis cordisporus is best identified by a study of the spores and veil. The veil of Coprinopsis stercorea consists of globose, thin-walled, finely-warted cells interspersed with narrow, branched hyphae, the spores cylindrical-elliptical in face-view. In contrast the veil cells of Coprinopsis cordisporus are globose, thin-walled, smooth, the spores pentagonal to heart-shaped in face-view. Other common dung-inhabiting Coprinus species include Coprinopsis radiata , similar in size to Coprinopsis stercorea but with a veil of cottony, wispy fibrils, (not granulose); Coprinopsis cinerea , a larger species, the expanded cap up to 4.0 cm broad, also with a veil of cottony fibrils, and Coprinellus pellucidus , diminutive like Coprinopsis stercorea , with a veil-less cap, the surface instead ornamented with cystidia, these sometimes visible with a strong hand lens."

Hydnum oregonense and H. repandum are similarly colored, but can be told apart through a combination of macroscopic and microscopic characters: Hydnum oregonense is smaller, more slender, has an indented or umbilicate cap, and the hymenium is not subdecurrent as is sometimes the case in H. repandum. Finally, the spores of Hydnum oregonense are significantly larger than those of H. repandum."

    "Comments": "Russula albidula is broadly interpreted here to describe what commonly occurs under oaks in the San Francsico Bay area. It is recognized by a cream-colored, glabrous, slightly striate-margined cap, mild to moderate acrid taste, white gills that soon become cream, and non-reticulate spores that are cream-yellow in deposit. It is often confused with Russula cremoricolor , but the latter has white gills and spores and a more acrid taste. Other cream-colored species include Russula burgeae , known only from Jackson State Forest in Mendocino Co., recognized by a tuberculate-striate cap margin, mild taste, cream-colored gills and spores that are partially reticulate. Russula albida also differs with a tuberculate-striate cap margin, but with white gills and spores. Other cream-colored species include Russula ochroleuca , with usually whitish spores that have a nearly complete reticulum; R. crenulata , also with whitish spores, but with finely serrated gill edges (thus the species epithet); and R. raoultii , an acrid species with nearly completely reticulate white spores. Finally another oak-dwelling Russula sometimes found with Russula albidula is Russula basifurcata. It has a cream-colored cap typically tinged pinkish, at least near the margin, cream gills and spores, and a mild taste. Reflecting the species name, the gills are often forked near the stipe. None of the above is known to have culinary value."

    "Comments": "Lycoperdon umbrinum is a blackish puffball often misidentified as Lycoperdon nigrescens (= L. foetidum ). The confusion is probably the result of conflicting interpretations in older field guides. Here we have relied primarily on Pegler, Laessoe, and Spooner in British Puffballs, Earthstars, Stinkhorns to separate the two. As noted by the authors, Lycoperdon umbrinum is variable, the color of the exoperidium ranging from medium-brown, reddish-brown, to blackish brown. California specimens tend towards the latter, thus the confusion with the often similarly colored Lycoperdon nigrescens. The two species, however, can be distinguished with other characters. Lycoperdon umbrinum , a cosmopolitan species, has an exoperidium composed of very short spines, <1 mm long, while the spines of L. nigrescens are >1 mm long, and unlike the former, when shed, leave scars on the endoperidium, much like those of L. perlatum. Indeed, Lycoperdon nigrescens has the aspect of a dark-colored Lycoperdon perlatum and was once considered to be a variety of the latter. Based on collections in the herbarium of San Francisco State University, Lycoperdon umbrinum is the common black puffball found in the San Francisco Bay area, while L. nigrescens is rare, if present at all. Lycoperdon nigrescens appears to be northern in distribution, found primarily in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, possibly far northern California. Lycoperdon umbrinum should be compared to Lycoperdon molle which is similar in size and shape, but typically has a greyish-brown to medium-brown exoperidium composed of spines of variable length, some grouped and mixed with furfuraceous granules. It is best distinguished microscopically by its coarsely warted spores and presence of sterigmatal remnants."

The cap of fresh specimens often shows bluish tints at the margin and disc, while the stipe base is frequently sheathed with bluish hairs and rooted when fruiting under bark. Unfortunately the bluish color which distinguishes the species is fleeting. Thus in old specimens a combination of characters is needed for an identification. These consist of a peelable, gelatinous cuticle, and at times, the formation of a collar-like ring by the gills at the stipe apex. Microscopically Mycena amicta is distinguished by the absence of pleurocystidia, cylindrical, clavate to subfusoid cheilocystidia and amyloid spores."

Several Albatrellus species also resemble Jahnoporus hirtus , but only A. pescaprae is likely to be confused with it. The latter is distinguished by a brown to mahogany-brown, more conspicuously pubescent cap, larger white to cream colored pores, and the stipe is neither grey/brown or pubescent. Microscopically, it can also be told apart by smooth, elliptical spores that are 4.5-9 x 5-6 µm. Note, our spore measurements for Jahnoporus hirtus are smaller than reported by Gilbertson (12.5-17 x 4.5-5.5 µm) but we have checked only a few collections."

    "Edibility": "Unknown; inconsequential.",
    "Comments": "A relative of the common bread mold, Rhizopus stolonifer (= R. nigricans ), Pilobolus roridus is recognized by tiny, nearly hyaline, filamentous fruiting bodies tipped with pinhead-sized black sporangia. It is distinguished from other Pilobolus species by relatively small, thin-walled, oblong-ellipsoid spores, <7 microns long, and a flattened-convex columella, seen only after the sporangium has dehisced. The epithet \"roridus\" refers to jewel-like droplets often seen on the stalk of the fruiting body, a conspicuous character, but not unique to the species. Pilobolus has fascinated generations of amateur and professional mycologists by virtue of fruiting bodies that track the sun and launch sporangia like cannonballs, in some cases up to two meters, a remarkable feat for a tiny fungus. This \"long distance dispersal\" addresses a critical phase in the Pilobolus life cycle which requires ingestion by a herbivore. Because horses and cows tend to avoid feeding near dung piles, sporangia are more likely to be consumed if landing on fresh grass a distance from where they originated. Ingested sporangia pass through the animal's gut unharmed and rapidly colonize freshly deposited dung. Within as little as a week, flushes of Pilobolus can appear. Interestingly, the Pilobolus -herbivore association sometimes involves a third organism, a parasitic nematode, species of the roundworm genus Dictyocaulus , a lung parasite of herbivores. Like the spores and sporangia of Pilobolus , one of the larval stages of the lung worm can pass through the herbivore's gut unscathed. Deposited in dung along with Pilobolus , their development coincides with that of the sporangiophores/fruiting bodies. As the sporangiophores nears maturity, some of the larvae climb past the gauntlet of stalk droplets to reach the sporangial cap where they and the sporangia are catapulted literally to \"greener pastures.\""

    "Comments": "Strobilurus diminutivus shares a feature common to the genus (except for Strobilurus albipilatus ), i.e. a cone-dwelling habit. A dozen tiny sporocarps may occupy a cone scale and hundreds may be found on a single cone of Pinus lambertiana (sugar pine). Despite this abundance, it is rarely collected because most fruitings are well hidden by overlapping cone scales. Strobilurus diminutivus is recognized by a pallid, pale-pink to tawny or dull-brown cap. The cap and stipe often have a fuzzy aspect when viewed with a hand lens due to the presence of cystidia. Strobilurus diminutivus is the only member of the genus in California that has the ability to revive after drying."

    "Comments": "Two forms of Rhodocollybia butyracea occurs in California, R. butyracea f. asema with a dingy light brown cap described above, and R. butyracea f. butyracea , with a cap that has reddish-brown tones. Both forms occur under pine, but the dingy brown form is the most common. The reddish cap tones of Rhodocollybia butyracea f. butyracea sometimes leads to confusion with the similarly colored Gymnopus dryophilus. Several characters, however, distinguish the two, the most obvious being habitat. Rhodocollybia butyracea (both forms) are typically found with pine, while the aptly named Gymnopus dryophilus is most common under oaks, occasionally venturing under pine. Morphologically the species can be separated by the nature of cap, lubricous in Rhodocollybia butryracea , moist in Gymnopus dryophilus. Additionally, the gill edges are serrulate at maturity in Rhodocollybia butryracea , while entire in Gymnopus dryophilus. Finally, the spores of Rhodocollybia butryracea are sporadically dextrinoid in Melzerâs reagent, the reaction absent in Gymnopilus dryophilus. Some greyish Melanoleuca species found under pine also bear a resemblance to Rhodocollybia butyracea f. asema , but their caps are not lubricous, the gill edges are not serrulate, and the spores are amyloid, not slightly dextrinoid in Melzerâs reagent."

We know it from only 4 sites under cypress along the San Mateo coast and are indebted to Mark Haley of the MSSF for pointing these out. It should be noted that Agaricus lilaceps is more common further south, especially in the Monterey Bay area, and is said to also occur on the campus of Stanford University under eucalyptus. Aside from size, Agaricus lilaceps is characterized by a robust stature, the stipe often club-shaped and well buried in the substrate, a cap with hazel-brown to dull-brown, appressed-fibrils/squamules, and a thick, white veil which sometimes becomes yellowish. The species epithet refers to the cap ornamentation of some specimens that may become lilac-brown. Related red-staining, cypress-inhabiting species include Agaricus pattersonae and A. fusco-fibrillosus. Agaricus pattersonae is very similar and takes practice to tell from A. lilaceps. The cap scales of Agaricus pattersonae are typically smaller, usually not as appressed, thus the underlying, pallid ground color is more apparent; in addition, the lower surface of the partial veil is more likely to develop pale brown patches, and never yellows; finally the stipe is more likely to have brown scaly rings at the base. A. fusco-fibrillosus is the most frequently encountered of the red-staining Agaricus species under cypress. It is smaller and less robust than A. pattersonae and has an appressed-fibrillose-squamose brown cap similar to A. lilaceps. Also distinctive is an annulus with a pale-brown margin and conspicuous scaly, pale-brown rings at the stipe base."

    "Edibility": "Unknown.",
    "Comments": "Sclerotinia sulcata is a stipitate cup fungus with an unusual fruiting habit. It typically fruits in standing water of montane marshes in the spring. Its rarity, drab color, and the likelihood of wet feet, all make this Ascomycete a challenging find. It is recognized by a brownish cup set on slender brown stipe attached to a typically submerged blackish sclerotium. Unfortunately, these features are shared to some extent with a more common Sclerotinia , S. veratri , also found in marshes, but is smaller, paler in color, and has shallower cups. Characteristic of the genus Sclerotinia , both species are plant pathogens, but on different plants, Sclerotinia sulcata on the culms of sedges ( Carex spp.), S. veratri on the stems of corn lilly ( Veratrum californicum ). Fruiting bodies of the two species develop in the spring from over-wintering blackish sclerotia. Besides Sclerotinia sulcata and S. veratri , one can find numerous small Ascomycetes fruiting in boggy areas. Two that are common and relatively easy to identify are Cudoniella clavus , a tiny buff to greyish stipitate disc on rotting marsh plants, and Mitrula elegans , the âmatch stick fungusâ, named for its yellowish fertile head and pallid stipe that resembles a match."

These include Geastrum fornicatum , Geastrum saccatum , and probably several additional species. Geastrum fornicatum and G. saccatum are relatively easy to recognize, the former by a basal mycelial cup from which rays and a spore sac are elevated, the latter by recurved rays at maturity. By comparison, the characters that define Geastrum coronatum are subtle, thus it is important to see a range of material. Fieldmarks include a debris-encrusted mycelial layer, which never forms a cup, and rays which moderately elevate the spore sac. The spore sac in many specimens has a short pedicel and an apophysis, i.e. a pinched area at the base. Sporocarps that develop in dry weather, may have incurved rather than flat to slightly recurved rays and resemble hygroscopic species like Astraeus hygrometricus. Significantly, however, once the rays of Geastrum coronatum mature, they do not respond to changes in humidity."

A relative of Boletus edulis , it is unusual in tending to fruit in clusters, frequently along dirt roads and trails. Despite these features, it is not necessarily an easy find. Like many montane mushrooms, fruitings may occur under a layer of dirt or duff. The cap color of Boletus rex-veris varies considerably with age. Young unexposed caps are nearly white, turning pinkish-tan with a silvery bloom, then drab olive-brown to dark-brown with mustard tints. Boletus rex-veris is a good example of a mushroom well known to mushroom hunters as it is a good edible, like its better known cousin, Boletus edulis. The latter differs in having a more clavate stipe and a brownish cap that lacks pinkish tints when young. Additionally, it rarely occur in clusters, and usually fruits in late summer or fall in the Sierra Nevada or winter in low elevation forests. Two other spring fruiting boletes that occur in montane habitats are Boletus regius and Boletus rubripes. Boletus regius mimics B. rex-veris in having a pinkish tinged cap when young, but the pores are bright yellow and bruise blue. Boletus rubripes is distinguished from B. rex-veris by a stipe that is reddish at the base and yellowish at the apex, lacking reticulations, and pores that bruise blue."

Suillus pungens , our most common slippery jack, can be distinguished by a viscid cap that goes through a series of color changes: at first white, then grey, orange to cinnamon-brown, finally dingy-buff, a gland-dotted stipe and a harsh, fruity odor. Suillus acerbus has a sticky, typically dull apricot-brown, buff-brown (sometimes tinged greyish), appressed to slightly scaly cap and stipe with prominent, glands, not merely dotted. Though not as common as Suillus pungens under Monterey pine, it is still more likely to be encountered than Suillus brevipes. It should be noted that the species epithet for Suillus brevipes , which suggests a short stipe, is something of a misnomer as stipe length is quite variable."

Characteristic of the genus is the lack of universal veil fragments on the cap and pileocystidia (setules), features which sets it apart from other small \"coprinoid\" fungi, e.g. Coprinellus micaceus , Coprinellus disseminatus , and Coprinopsis friesii. Parasola lactea is closely related to Parasola plicatilis (= Coprinus plicatilis ). The two species in fact cannot be told apart reliably without examining the spores, those of Parasola plicatilis being distinctly larger. Macroscopically, Parasola plicatilis is said to be slightly smaller, more greyish, and appears more restricted to grassy habitats compared to the ecologically variable Parasola lactea. Parasola lactea is the dominant species in the San Francisco Bay area, but it is possible that the reverse is true elsewhere. Parasola plicatilis has been reported from southern California, but its exact distribution in California is unknown. Parasola lactea should also be compared with Parasola auricoma. The latter is larger, more tawny-brown overall, has filamentous cap setae (visible with a strong hand lens), and narrowly attached or barely free gills."

    "Comments": "Entoloma lividoalbum is characterized by a Tricholoma -like stature, a nearly glabrous, dingy-brown cap often with a lighter disc, a translucent-striate margin, solid stipe, and a faint farinacous odor and taste, the odor most apparent when the cap tissue is crushed. Entoloma lividoalbum belongs to a group of macroscopically similar, not easily separated taxa. To identify a species often requires careful study of the cap, stipe, odors if present, and in some cases microscopic features. Similar Entolomas include Entoloma sericatum , common under oaks, but with a dark-brown cap, lighter towards a striate margin, the cap context <8 mm thick at the stipe, and a momentary nitrous odor that becomes farinaceous; Entoloma rhodopolium is a slender species, with a relatively thin cap <7 mm thick near the stipe, the margin translucent-striate, sometimes halfway to the disc, a stipe that is often hollow at maturity, and a weak farinaceous odor; Entoloma cinereolamellatum has a dark-brown cap that may become dingy orange-brown at the disc, thus appearing two-toned, the cap context >10 mm thick near the stipe, the gills greyish when young; Entoloma nidorosum is found under conifers, with a yellowish-tan cap and marginal striations reaching halfway to the disc, the cap context <7mm thick near the stipe, and a strong nitrous odor when fresh. For more information on these and other species, consult the Entolomataceae of the Western United State s by David Largent."

Fortunately, Kris Shanks's monograph of California Tricholomas has made it possible to sort out the various species. Among the easiest to distinguish is Tricholoma atroviolaceum by virtue of a dry, dark grey-brown, fibrillose-squamulose cap, usually with violet tones when young, and a stipe with yellowish to tawny-brown stains at the base in age. Other similarly colored Tricholomas that may be encountered include Tricholoma luteomaculosum , with a dry, fibrillose (not squamulose) greyish-brown cap, the latter sometimes with a yellowish-brown disc; Tricholoma virgatum , with a dry, streaked (not fibrillose), dark-grey, umbonate cap; Tricholoma portentosum , with a viscid, streaked, dark-grey cap, sometimes developing yellow tints in the cap and stipe, and Tricholoma griseoviolaceum with a streaked, grey-violet, viscid cap, but not yellowish in either the cap or stipe. Finally, unlikely to be confused with any of the above species because of its small size is Tricholoma myomyces var. cystidiotum , which has a dry fibrillose-sqamulose grey cap, and a grey fibrillose veil."

It is believed to be part of a group of closely related, but hard to distinguish species. One of these is Agaricus albolutescens , a shorter, stockier mushroom with a white cap and strong yellowing reaction when bruised. For several reasons, Agaricus sylvicola and its relatives are not recommended to beginners for the table. Besides the occasional adverse reactions that have been reported, it bears a close resemblance to Agaricus xanthodermus , a toxic though not dangerously poisonous species. Like Agaricus sylvicola , it may have a nearly white cap, but can be separated by a phenolic odor and stipe base that yellows quickly when bruised. A potentially far more serious problem for the inexperienced mycophagist is the possibility of confusion with the white form of Amanita phalloides , the Death Cap.

It looks like a cross between a Blewit ( Clitocybe nuda ), and an oyster mushroom ( Pleurotus ostreatus ), but despite it attractive appearance and non toxic reputation, it's too tough to have culinary value. A related species, Panus rudis , has a conspicuously hairy, reddish-brown cap, sometimes with purple tones when young, but is rare in our area."

    "Comments": "This beautiful species is recognized by a striking dark blue fibrillose cap and stipe. Its relatively large size helps to distinguish it from the many blue and often difficult to identify \"Leptonias\" in California. Of these, Leptonia pigmentosipes is most similar with a deep blue cap and stipe and fibrillose ornamentation, but it differs with smaller size, gills that are whitish to greyish, and unlike the farinaceous odor of Entoloma carneum , has a mild odor and taste. Another more common relative, Entoloma medianox , is larger and more robust with a cap that is not as intensely blue, often bluish grey with a paler margin, whitish gills when young, and a whitish stipe that is tinge bluish mostly in the upper half. Entoloma carneum should also be compared with bluish or purplish species of the genus Cortinarius. These can be distinguished by their rusty brown spore prints."

    "Comments": "Lysurus mokusin combines a fetid odor with a fruiting body that imitates rotting flesh.

Its distribution is nonetheless limited, found only in parks and gardens etc. Like other California stinkhorns, with perhaps the exception of Phallus hadriani , Lysurus mokusin is though to be an introduced species, arriving on nursery stock from tropical regions. It is recognized by a strongly ribbed pseudostipe and reddish \"cap\" composed of four to five furrowed, clasped arms. A related paler species, Lysurus cruciatus (= L. borealis ), has a round, not ribbed pseudostipe, and at maturity, spreading, not clasped arms."

    "Comments": "Naematelia aurantia resembles and is often confused with Tremella mesenterica. Both species have convoluted yellowish-orange fruiting bodies, are similar in size, occur on hardwoods, and like all Tremellas, are parasitic on other fungi. As is often the case with closely related taxa, a combination of characters is needed for identification. Here we've relied on the work of British mycologist Peter Roberts to separate the species. Tremella aurantia is most easily distinguished by its host preference, attacking the common wood rotter, Stereum hirsutum , while Tremella mesenterica parasitizes species of Peniophora , a resupinate fungus. Naematelia aurantia is also somewhat larger and has a duller surface when dry. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, and stalked, not sessile basidia. The ubiquitious nature of Stereum hirsutum , helps explains its abundance. The frequency of Tremella mesenterica , on the other hand, is unclear and remains to be determined."

Phyllotopsis nidulans can be distinguished by a hardwood habit, apricot-orange, pubescent cap, straight, not wavy gills, and skunk odor. Lentinellus ursinus has a dull-brown, similarly-shaped cap but has gills with serrulate edges and an unpleasant taste. Crepidotus mollis mimics the overlapping shelves of Paxillus panuoides , but grows largely on hardwoods; additionally, its cap lacks ochre tones, and the gills are not intervenose or wrinkled; The occasional fruitings of Tapinella panuoides on wood chips should be compared with Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca , a distant relative with a similar colored cap, often abundant on this substrate.

    "Comments": "Compared to the dull hues of most Mycenas, Mycena acicula is a visual treat, the tiny caps bright reddish-orange, complemented by a yellowish stipe. What adaptive value the brilliant coloration conveys if any, is unclear, but it is a character shared by a small number of Mycenas. These include, Mycena oregonensis , M. aurantiidisca , M. adonis , and M. strobilinoides. Mycena oregonensis differs in possessing a more yellowish to yellow-orange cap, the stipe yellow-pruinose, dry, not viscid. Mycena aurantiidisca can usually be distinguished by a reddish-orange cap that fades to white at the margin. Mycena adonis as interpreted here has a cap with pinkish tones, i.e. pinkish-red, rather than reddish-orange and a pink to white stipe. Finally, Mycena strobilinoides , which mimicks M. acicula with a bright reddish-orange cap, is distinctly larger, up to 2.0 cm broad, has amyloid spores unlike the above species, and is presently known only from under conifers in northwestern California. Molecular studies suggest that these brightly colored species may not belong in Mycena and at some point could be transferred to new or other genera."

    "Comments": "Butyriboletus autumniregius is a beautiful, robust bolete with an aspect similar to Boletus edulis. A notable difference, however, is that Butyriboletus autumniregius has a rose-pink cap while Boletus edulis has a brownish cap. Additionally, the pore surface and stipe reticulation of Butyriboletus autumniregius are yellowish, compared to pallid in Boletus edulis. A final distinction is the tendency for the pores of Butyriboletus autumniregius to blue, a feature absent in Boletus edulis. Spring fruitings in the Sierra of a similar mushroom is Butyriboletus primiregius. They should be compared with Boletus rex-veris , a close relative of Boletus edulis , and the occasional fruiting of Caloboletus rubripes. Boletus rex-veris has a somewhat similarly colored cap when young, pinkish-brown to dull rusty-brown, but the pore surface in youth is pallid not lemon-yellow and the stipe reticulation light-brown over a cream-colored background. Caloboletus rubripes is easily distinguished by the lack of a reticulated stipe and a bitter taste. In coastal forests Butyriboletus autumniregius is often confused with a close relative, Butyriboletus persolidus. The latter, however, has a rusty-brown to yellowish-brown cap as opposed to rose-pink in Butyriboletus autumniregius."

    "Comments": "Pholiota molesta is one of several Pholiota species that fruit in the charred aftermath of forest fires. Although a small group, a tangle of nomenclatural names and confused species concepts have complicated their identification. Fortuitously, a 2019 study by Matheny et. al. clarifies the taxonomy of North American pyrophilous Pholiotas and refines their descriptions. One result is that Pholiota molesta , a common Sierra post-fire species, is thought to often be misidentified as P. highlandensis. Both species occur in California but usually can be told apart with a combination of characters. Pholiota molesta is recognized by a short, squat, to normal stature, cap when young, pinkish brown to orange brown, developing reddish brown areas, later becoming brownish overall, an initial whitish fibrillose veil that eventually forms orange brown to brown bands on the lower stipe, and narrow, often crowded gills. Pholiota highlandensis typically has a slender stature, cap that varies from cream buff, light brown, tawny brown to brown, (but not pinkish brown), whitish veil that may or may not form brownish scales on the lower stipe, and relatively broad gills. A third Pholiota , P. brunnescens , found more commonly in northern California, is recognized by comparatively large size, cap up to 70 mm broad, often clustered fruitings, broad gills, and an orange brown bruising stipe reaction. The Matheny et.al. study also reduced the number of North American species reported in the literature from seven to four, synonymizing Pholiota carbonaria and P. fulvozonata with P. highlandensis ; P. luteobadia with Pholiota brunnescens ; and P. subsaponacea with P. molesta. It should be noted that besides burn Pholiotas, a few other gill mushrooms occur in this habitat, the most similar of which is Crassisporium funariophilum , formerly known as Pachylepyrium carbonicola. It is recognized by a glabrous, rusty brown to brown cap, thin stipe, fibrillose veil, and microscopically by spores that are thick-walled and angular in faceview."

    "Edibility": "Presumably edible like most true puffballs when young and the gleba still white.",
    "Comments": "Calvatia booniana is California's largest puffball and the western counterpart to Calvatia gigantea , an equally large but usually smooth-skinned puffball found east of the Rocky Mountains. Besides size, distinguishing characters are a subglobose to cushion shape, broad flat to raised warts with brownish centers, and a root-like basal attachment. Although it is widely distributed in the western U.S., it is not common in California except in wet years. Calvatia booniana is sometimes confused with three medium-sized puffballs: Calbovista subsculpta , Calvatia sculpta , and Calvatia pachyderma. Calbovista subsculpta is most similar with an exoperidium of broad warts, and a rooted base, but it possesses a well developed subgleba, a feature lacking in Calvatia booniana. Microscopically the capillitium of Calbovista subsculpta is distinctive, composed of individual elements with short antler-like side branches. Calvatia sculpta is recognized by large, hooked warts and a usually well developed pseudostipe. Calvatia pachyderma differs in a nearly smooth exoperidium and fruiting body that tends to open by large vertical splits. A fourth species, Calvatia polygonia , known from Colorado, but not yet documented as occurring in California is very similar to Calvatia booniana. It is distinguished by conspicuously ornamented spores."

Molecular studies indicate that it is part of species complex centered around Megacollybia platyphylla , a taxa now believed to be restricted to Europe and Asia. Several similar species occur in the U.S., their geographic distribution an important distinguishing character. Megacollybia fallax occurs in the western United States, while other species occur in the eastern and central U.S. Megacollybia fallax should be compared with species of Pluteus , Tricholoma , as well as larger Mycenas. Pluteus species such as P. atromarginatus and P. petasatus have similar colored caps and also occur on woody substrates, but are distinguished by free gills that are pinkish at maturity; similar colored Tricholomas differ in lacking a lignicolous habit and often have a farinaceous odor; Mycenas, like M. overholtzii and M. galericulata , are also found on or near wood but lack the broad, well-spaced gills of Megacollybia fallax and differ microscopically in possessing amyloid spores."

Like many Ascomycetes, it fruits from mid to late winter. A smaller relative, Pseudosarcosoma latahense , has a less gelatinous context at maturity, but is otherwise similar, and requires a microscope to accurately determine. Several other black cup fungi resemble Urnula padeniana. Most common is Bulgaria inquinans which often fruits in large numbers on hardwood logs. Its blackish-brown rubbery cups have a furfuraceous rather than wrinkled exterior; Plectania melastoma , also lignicolous, is a thin-fleshed, sub-stipitate black cup that has a persistently incurved margin often tinged orange from granules encrusting the external hyphae; Plectania milleri differs from the above in possessing a toothed cup margin and lacks encrusting orange granules. In montane regions, two additional black cups are found in the spring. Donadinia nigrella , a snowbank species, forms black goblet-shaped cups on thin, slender stipes attached to rotting wood. Less conspicuous and infrequent is Pseudoplectania nigrella , a small, sessile to substipipitate cup with a hairy exterior."

We have chosen to follow Holecâs 2012 treatment of Gymnopilus penetrans in Funga Nordica, in part because the species was described from Europe and because Holecâs description matches closely material found in the San Francisco Bay Area. Gymnopilus penetrans is confusable with several California Gymnopilus species. Most similar is Gymnopilus sapineus , at one time considered conspecific with G. penetrans. According to Holec, Gymnopilus sapineus , like G. penetrans can have a tawny colored cap with a paler margin, but the cap is âfibrillose-tomentose to finely scalyâ, a character best seen at the disc. Additionally the young gills and stipe are more yellow than in G. penetrans. Another look-alike, Gymnopilus luteocarneus , described by Hesler, is a smaller species, only 3-5 cm broad, the cap rusty-orange and glabrous; it differs in possessing a yellowish veil and microscopically by well-developed pleurocystidia that extend beyond the height of the basidia. Gymnopilus echinulispsorus described by Murrill also mimics G. penetrans , with a rusty orange, glabrous appearing cap, but unlike the latter, it lacks a veil, pleurocystidia, and has spores that are echinulate as the species epithet suggests."

Interestingly, both types look similar and can not be distinguished without biochemical analysis. Agaricus bisporus , though not as distinctive as other Agaricus species, can be recognized by the following combination of characters: relatively short stature, cap with pale brown appressed scales, flesh which bruises slowly orange-brown to reddish- brown, but does not stain yellow in KOH, a well developed ring, smooth stipe, and a preference for fruiting with Monterey cypress. Agaricus californicus and A. xanthodermus also occur under Monterey Cypress but the latter bruises bright yellow on the cap margin and stipe base, while the former, though similar in stature, has a distinctive double-lipped ring (best seen in fresh, young material), and stains yellow in KOH. Agaricus bisporus is sometimes also confused with A. campestris , the Meadow Mushroom, but the latter grows in grass, usually away from trees, lacks the brown cap scales of A. bisporus, has an evanescent ring, and a tapered stipe base."

Two other mushrooms that could be mistaken for Cantharellus subalbidus include Tricholoma magnivelare and Leucopaxillus albissimus. Tricholoma magnivelare , a choice edible in its own right, also tends to bruise yellow to tawny-brown, but the gills are not decurrent, and it has a well developed veil and a strong spicy odor; Leucopaxillus albissimus is a large, white mushroom often associated with redwood or eucalyptus.

    "Comments": "Tubaria punicea is a rare and beautiful mushroom recognized by a dark-red to reddish-purple cap, vinaceous gills that at maturity become ochre-brown to cinnamon-brown from spore deposit, and a vinaceous, fibrillose-striate stipe. Its habit of fruiting on rotting madrone, helps distinguish it from a very closely related species, Tubaria vinicolor (= Naucoria vinicolor ) which occurs on woody debris in disturbed habitats, e.g. urban parks. Tubaria punicea should be compared with several unrelated, small reddish mushrooms, the most common of which is Hypholoma aurantiaca , recently reclassified as Leratiomyces ceres. The latter is found abundantly on wood chips, but is more reddish-orange in color, has a pallid colored stipe, and purple-brown spores; the Candy Cap, Lactarius rubidus , bears a resemblance as well, but is terrestrial, not lignicolous, has a milky-watery latex, buff- colored spores, and a pleasing brown sugar odor which intensifies with drying. Two Hygrocybe species, Hygrocybe punicea and H. coccinea could also be confused with Tubaria punicea. They have bright-red caps but differ in waxy gills, a terrestrial habitat, and white spores; another mimic Laccaria laccata var. pallidifolia has a vinaceous cap and somewhat fibrous stipe, but is terrestrial and white spored.

    "Spores": "Spores 5-7 x 4.0-5.0 µm, oval, smooth. Spore print white.",
    "Habitat": "Late summer to early fall on logs and stumps of hardwoods. It is particularly common on species of Eucalyptus.",
    "Edibility": "Edible with caution. Prized by many, this species is also known to occasionally cause gastrointestinal upsets. This appears to be caused by eating old and/or insufficiently cooked specimens. If you decide to try it, eat only the young, fresh, growing margins, in small quantities, and cook it thoroughly.",
    "Comments": "The brilliant yellow-orange, fleshy shelves of Laetiporus gilbertsonii are unlikely to be mistaken for any other fungus. The sulphur shelf is unusual in that it fruits well before the start of Bay Area rainy season, often in very dry weather. Nonetheless, fruitings, which can be massive, can literally exude moisture. The brightly-colored shelves persist several weeks, then fade to greyish-white, crumble and fall to the ground. Old fruitings on Eucalyptus are frequently infested with termites. Fruitings repeat year after year from the same stump or log."

    "Comments": "Bjerkandera adusta is a seldom collected leathery bracket fungus that can be confused with the turkey tail fungus, Trametes versicolor. Like the turkey tail, the brackets of Bjerkandera adusta are tomentose-velvety and zonate, but the banding is muted, in shades of brown and grey, while those of Trametes versicolor are distinctly zoned and often multicolored (white, brown, rusty brown, yellow, blue and black). In the field Bjerkandera adusta can easily be distinguished from Trametes versicolor by a greyish to blackish (not white) finely pored hymenial surface. A closely related species, Bjerkandera fumosa differs only in slightly larger, thicker fruitbodies, the pore surface not as dark, and the presence of a black line separating the tube layer from the context. Another bracket fungus, Cerrena unicolor , uncommon in California, has a cap similar to Bjerkandera adusta , also occurs on hardwoods, but has a two layered context with a blackish line separating the layers. More significantly, the pores, although greyish, become labyrinthoid to dentate in age. Less likely to be confused with Bjerkandera adusta are Trametes betulina , until recently known as Lenzites betulina , which has a hymenium of gill-like plates, and Stereum species which have a smooth hymenial surface."

Also characteristic are color changes that occur when the flesh is injured: at first yellowish, then reddish-brown to brown. Dried specimens are distinctive, turning entirely vinaceous-brown. Leucoagaricus americanus is distantly related to several toxic species, Chlorophyllum molybdites , Lepiota helveola and L. josserandii. Chlorohyllum molybdites is a large, scaly-capped, green-spored species (at maturity), that prefers grassy areas and warm climes. It is known to cause strong G.I. upsets. Lepiota helveola and L. josserandii are small squamulose species that are reported to contain the same toxins as the Death Cap, Amanita phalloides. Both require a microscope to be identified."

Suillus fuscotomentosus can be told from S. pungens by a less viscid, typically squamulose cap and from S. brevipes by a gland-dotted stipe. Another squamulose slippery jack that resembles Suillus fuscotomentosus but is associated with 2-needle pines along the coast ( Pinus muricata and P. contorta ) is S. tomentosus. Besides habitat differences, it is distinguished by a cap with lighter colored scales which redden in cold weather, and pores which bruise blue. Finally, Suillus fuscotomentosus is also very similar to Suillus acerbus. As noted by Arora, these two taxa appear to intergrade, specimens within a collection varying enough to fit either species. For the present, we have chosen to use the name Suillus fuscotomentosus for material in this group, acknowledging that the choice is arbitrary and with further study could change."

Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to tell where dirt and the normally greyish-brown pigments of this mushroom begin and end. Young specimens are typically off-white to dingy-cream, but soon become tinged grey-brown to black or when bruised, vinaceous-pink, then grey-brown to black. Complicating matters, two other Russulas, R. dissimulans and Russula nigricans are very similar and not easily distinguished by inexperienced collectors. Russula dissimulans differs in having a moist to dry, not subviscid cap, and subdistant gills. Russula nigricans typically has thick, distant gills, but according to Thiers may intergrade with R. dissimulans. To identify these species with confidence, a microscope is needed as cuticle thickness and spore ornamentation are important distinguishing features.

It is most easily recognized after periods of rain, when the shallow black cups have a glossy sheen, in sharp contrast to the scurfy, brown exterior. Only Urnula padeniana and Psuedosarcosoma latahense are similar. These Ascomycete cousins are also black, rubbery, and cupulate, but differ in having a wrinkled, not scurfy exterior. Additionally, they fruit singly or in small numbers on small branches, never in large groups on logs. Unrelated to Bulgaria inquinans is the Basidiomycete jelly fungus Exidia glandulosa. It mimics Bulgaria inquinans with black, gelatinous fruitings on rotting hardwoods, but these are cerebriform, not cupulate."

    "Comments": "With features that straddle Hygrophorus and Clitocybe , it is not surprising that that there has been uncertainty regarding the affinities of this snowbank mushroom. It is now generally placed in the genus Pseudoomphalina , which differs from the above in the combination of cap and gill tissue that redden in KOH and amyloid spores. Pseudoomphalina angelesiana can be recognized by its clitocyboid stature, dark-brown, hygrophanous, centrally depressed cap, lilac-tinged, decurrent gills and lilac-colored mycelium at the stipe base. Somewhat similar is Arrhenia obscurata. The latter, however, is a smaller mushroom with a dark-grey cap and gills in age, and a preference for exposed sites, and humus-free soils. Compare also with Laccaria pumila , another montane mushroom similar in shape, but with a reddish-brown to orange-brown cap and flesh-colored, not lilac-tinged gills. Microscopically it differs in having inamyloid, echinulate spores."

    "Edibility": "Inedible, woody.",
    "Comments": "Our best known shelf fungus, Ganoderma applanatum is distinguished from other woody polypores by a dull grey-brown, bumpy, usually zonate cap, often powdered brown from released spores, and a white pore surface which instantly darkens when injured. The latter feature makes it a favorite of artists which use the smooth white surface as a canvas. Like a number of perennial woody conks, the age of a fruiting body can be roughly determined by sectioning and counting the tube layers. Related fungi include Ganoderma tsugae , uncommon in our area, with a shiny red/brown to mahogany brown cap and pores that do not bruise and Fomitopsis pinicola with a reddish-brown cap margin and pores that bruise slowly pale yellowish-buff. One other Ganoderma that occurs in California is Ganoderma brownii.

Although unlikely to be confused with Tricholoma moseri , two other Tricholomas are found near melting snowbanks, Tricholoma vernaticum and Tricholoma saponaceum. The former is a large robust mushroom, the cap pale, up to 15.0 cm broad, with a strong cucumber/farinaceous odor, and thin annulus, while the latter has a relatively smooth cap with olive, yellow, grey, and brown tones, and a soapy odor that develops in age. A third Tricholoma , T. myomyces var. cystidiotum could easily be mistaken for T. moseri because of its small size and dark, squamulose cap. It, however, fruits in the fall in coastal forests, and possesses a sparse partial veil as well as smaller spores."

Unfortunately for mycophagists, it often grows well protected in a thick understory of Toxicodendron diversilobum (poison oak). Collectors should be aware that other yellow mushrooms are occasionally mistaken for the chanterelle, notably Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca (false chanterelle), Ompahlotus olivascens (jack o'lantern fungus), and Gomphus floccosus (wooly chanterelle). Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is a less fleshy, buff to orangish, probably edible species that grows on rotting wood or wood chips; an important field character is its dichotomously branched, brightly colored, true gills. Omphalotus olivascens , a toxic species, usually has an eccentric stipe, a yellowish-olive color, true gills, and grows either on rotting wood or at the base of hardwoods. Gomphus floccosus is a chanterelle relative which can cause stomach upsets. It also has a vase-like shape, but can be distinguished by a cap which has a hollow center surrounded by orange scales. Other yellow chanterelles in California include Cantharellus formosus and Cantharellus roseocanus. Also in California is Cantharellus subalbidus , another edible species that differs from the yellow chanterelles in being pallid to almost white in color and having white spores."

According to Inocybe expert Dr. Brandon Matheny, Inocybe armeniaca (= I. whitei f. armeniaca (Huijsman) Kuyper), is smaller than I. pudica (= I. whitei B. & Br. ( Sacc.) f. whitei sensu Kuyper), the cap less than 2.5 cm broad, compared to up to 4 cm for the latter, and occurs commonly with cottonwood ( Populus spp.) as opposed to mostly with conifers. Complicating matters, Inocybe armeniaca and Inocybe pudica are considered variants of singly morphological species in Europe. Lacking taxonomic accord, the species epithet I. pudica , a name familiar to many users, is used here. Besides the above taxa, another pallid Inocybe that reddens is I. godeyi. It differs from Inocybe pudica in possessing a more fibrillose, slightly ochre-colored cap, a stipe that is pruinose over its entire length, the base more bulbous and often marginate, and a preference for hardwoods."

    "Comments": "Rhodocollybia maculata is a cream-colored mushroom that, as the species epithet suggests, becomes spotted in age. The mottling, usually tawny to rusty-brown, is most obvious on the cap but can also be seen on the gills and stipe. Other fieldmarks include a fruiting habit on rotting conifer wood, and a conspicuously striate stipe. Several varieties have been described differing in color and spore shape. Variety maculata , described above, appears to be the most common in California. Rhodocollybia maculata 's closest relatives, Rhodocollybia badiialba , Rhodocollybia oregonensis , and Rhodocollybia butyracea vary in cap color from tan, reddish-brown to dark vinaceous-brown, but lack spots. In the Sierra Nevada, Rhodocollybia maculata should be compared with two snowbank species, Mycena overholtzii and Megacollybia platyphylla. Both occur on rotting wood, the former in clusters, the latter usually in small groups. Mycena overholtzii has a light-grey to tan, striate-margined cap with a conspicuously pubescent stipe base, while Megacollybia platyphylla has a dark grey to brown cap and broad gills. Neither species is spotted in age."

    "Comments": "Sarcosphaera montana is a cup fungus with a largely underground development. Only at maturity does the ascocarp, a hollow ball-like structure, break through the soil surface and open. Even then, fruitings can be inconspicuous, often looking like irregular-shaped holes in the ground. Closer inspection, however, reveals the distinctive lavender-colored hymenial surface of this cup fungus. Sarcosphera montana is a common spring species found throughout the Western United States in montane regions. It is sometimes used as an morel indicator, because of its similar fruiting period."

This type of development is called secotioid or sequestrate, with examples known from a number of genera of gilled and boletaceous mushrooms. Two such fungi that resemble Agaricus deserticola are Podaxis pistillaris and Montagnea arenaria. Both are found primarily in the desert regions of California. Podaxis pistillaris has an elongated, scaly cap, much like a shaggy mane, Coprinus comatus , but is not deliquescent and despite the similarities, probably is not closely related. Montagnea arenaria is a stalked puffball distantly allied to Coprinus. It has a woody stipe which emanates from a volva cup, and is crowned by thin umbrella of crumpled, blackish gill-like tissue."

    "Comments": "Hygrophorus subalpinus is a robust montane species recognized by stocky stature, a white, glabrous cap, waxy often decurrent gills, and an evanescent partial veil that typically leaves a thin volva-like remnant on the lower stipe. Like a number of montane species, the fruiting bodies of Hygrophorus subalpinus develop partially under the duff, protected from the often dry mountain air. Investigating mounds of fresh litter is the key to finding this and ecologically similar species. Hygrophorus subalpinus should be compared with unrelated white mushrooms such as Amanita ocreata , Tricholoma murrillianum (Matsutake), Trichololma vernaticum , and Russula brevipes. Amanita ocreata is a toxic spring fruiting species that is similar with a cream colored cap, but has a more upright stature, lacks decurrent gills and occurs under oaks at lower elevations. Tricholoma murrillianum is a robust white species that closely resembles Hygrophorus subalpinus with a sheathing basal veil, and sometimes fruits under montane pines. It is easily distinguished, however, by a spicy odor, rusty brown stains that develop on the fruiting body, and a fall fruiting habit. Another Tricholoma , T. vernaticum fruits in the spring under montane conifers, but the cap is greyish, the gills are not decurrent, and it has a strong raw potato or cucumber odor. Russula brevipes is also similar in stature to Hygrophorus subalpinus , but rarely fruits in the spring and differs with brittle stipe, gill, and cap tissues."

Xerocomellus mendocinensis , however, is less likely than X. diffractus to develop pinkish tones in cracks near the cap margin, and in our experience the pores bruise blue almost instantly, while in X. diffractus , this reaction takes several seconds with the blueing never as intense. Nonetheless, a microscope is required to make a positive identification. Xerocomellus mendocinensis spores are, as the species name suggests, blunt or clipped at one end, those of X. diffractus , rounded."

Additionally, the two species tend to be found in disimilar habitats, Chlorophyllum molybdites preferring warmer, inland locations and grass, while Chlorophyllum brunneum predominates in coastal areas, fruiting in cypress, eucalyptus duff, etc., or near compost heaps. Chlorogphyllum rachodes differs from Chlorophyllum brunneum in having an enlarged to clavate, but not abruptly-bulbous stipe, and for that reason is more likely to be confused with Chlorophyllum molybdites."

Unusual for a bolete, it often fruits on moss-covered logs and stumps, particularly those of hemlock ( Tsuga heterophylla ). Aureoboletus mirabilis is unlikely to be mistaken for any other California bolete, but it bears a slight resemblance to the terrestrial polypore Scutiger pes-carpae , known more commonly as Albatrellus pes-carprae. The latter also has a matted tomentose to squamulose cap, which can be brown to maroon. Its stipe, however, is typically eccentric in attachment, and it has a tough, leathery context. Like many boletes, Aureoboletus mirabilis is prone to attack by Hypomyces spp. molds, a factor to consider when collecting for the table."

Some Amanita species have cap warts (remnants of a universal veil) superficially resembling the scales in Chlorophyllum brunneum , but these can be easily rubbed off, while the scales in the Shaggy Parasol must be torn off. Additionally, Chlorophyllum brunneum , while having a bulbous base, lacks the true volva of an Amanita. Chlorophyllum molybdites , a cousin of the Shaggy parasol, is a toxic species and similar in appearance, but mature specimens can be told apart by their olive-green gills and spore print.

Agaricus arorae was first described from Santa Cruz Co. but since has been found in San Mateo and Alameda counties. Other sylvan Agaricus species that resemble A. arorae include A. hondensis , A. subrutilescens , A. fusco-fibrillosus , and A. fuscovelatus. Agaricus hondensis has a lighter brown cap, a thick white annulus, bulbous stipe base, yellows in KOH, but lacks a red-staining reaction. Agaricus subrutilescens has a cap with dark-brown fibrils/scales, a stipe covered with conspicuous floccose-cottony scales, and does not stain red, although the gills of young specimens may redden when bruised. Agaricus fuscofibrillosus , another fibrillose to squamulose species, can be separated by color reactions and habitat. It reddens when bruised, but does not yellow with KOH, and occurs only with Monterey Cypress a habitat not known for A. arorae. Finally, another red-staining species, Agaricus fuscovelatus , is found only with conifers, usually pines. It has a conic-shaped cap when young, and a distinctive coco-colored veil.

    "Comments": "This montane species recognized by a whitish cap, partial veil which remains attached to the cap at maturity, and tendency to fruit below ground. It is a common find of spring bolete hunters that unintentionally unearth it while seeking their more desirable quarry. Cortinarius verrucisporus is a less common relative that sometimes occurs with C. magnivelatus. It is distinguished by a yellow to tawny cap (at maturity) and yellowish partial veil. Smith and Thiers (1969) described several additional Cortinarii, all of which share the characteristics of a persistent veil and subsurface fruiting. These include Cortinarius wiebae with a whitish to tan-colored cap and fragile gills that are brownish even in youth; Cortinarius bigelowii , very short statured, with a tan cap and marginate, bulbous stipe; and Cortinarius velatus with a vinaceous to purple cap. None of these are common."

Its snowbank habit, fruiting on the undersurface of downed conifer branches, is also a helpful though not infallible character. Many Crepidotus species are similar and a microscope is often needed to make an identification. Similar to Crepidotus fimbriatus and sometimes found fruiting with it is Lentinellus montanus. The latter can be distinguished by its generally larger size, pinkish-brown cap, serrated gills, bitter taste, and white spores."

Other Pluteus species that could be confused with the Deer Mushroom include P. magnus and P. atromarginatus. Pluteus magnus is a more compact, stout mushroom with a nearly black, wrinkled cap while P. atromarginatus , as its latin name suggests, can be recognized by its dark gill edges. Some Entoloma species resemble Pluteus cervinus in size and spore color, but all have attached gills and are terrestrial, not lignicolous. A related genus, Volvariella is distinguished by a volva."

    "Comments": "Known as Lyophyllum montanum in older field guides, this common snowbank species has a distinctive silvery-grey cap and stipe. In age it is less identifiable, becoming a nondescript greyish-brown. Usually, however, remnants of the canescent cap surface can still be detected with a hand-lens. This feature combined with close, greyish gills, and a dense mycelial mat at the base of the stipe, help to distinguish mature specimens from Melanoleuca species with which it sometimes fruits. If in doubt, the latter can be distinguished microscopically by amyloid, warted spores. Compare also with Clitocybe albirhiza , a less robust, variably-brown mushroom, which also has a canescent cap, but with fibrils typically arranged in a zonate pattern, and has conspicuous white rhizomorphs at the base."

Like Gyromitra esculenta it contains monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and should be avoided. See \"Comments\" under Gyromitra esculenta for distinguishing features of that species, Gyromitra montana and Gyromitra californica. Gyromitra infula is mostly likely to be confused with saddle-shaped species of Helvella with smooth stipes. e.g. Helvella compressa and H. elastica. These species can be separated by their greyer caps and pallid stipes. If in doubt, a spore examination will confirm an identification, at least to genus.

    "Comments": "No single feature defines Pholiota olivaceophylla. Nonetheless, it has a \"look\" that with experience makes it relatively easy to identify. In the San Francisco Bay area, Pholiota olivaceophylla has a viscid, hygrophanous, glabrous cap that is tawny to yellow-brown at the disc, cream to pale-yellow at the margin, but lacks the olivaceous tones cited by Smith and Hesler in a monograph of the genus. An evanescent fibrillose partial veil, mild odor and taste, plus a dingy reddish-brown spore print are also helpful identifying characters. Pholiota olivaceophylla is part of a group of wood-rotting fungi that have taken advantage of the practice of mulching roadsides and parks with wood chips. The result is that some of these species are more common here than in the wild. Several bear a resemblance to Pholiota olivaceophylla , thus should be compared closely. These include Hypholoma fasiculare (sulphur tuft), Agrocybe praecox , Agrocybe putaminum , and Stropharia riparia. The Sulphur Tuft is typically more yellowish in color and has a non-viscid cap, yellow-green gills, bitter taste, and purple-brown spores; Stropharia riparia differs in possessing an evenly colored cream-yellow, non-viscid cap and purple-brown spores; Agrocybe praecox resembles Stropharia riparia with a cream to buff-colored, non-viscid cap, but in addition has a membranous annulus and dull brown spores; a more robust cousin Agrocybe putaminum too has a nonviscid buff-colored cap, but lacks an annulus; its spores are dull brown, not dingy reddish-brown in deposit."

    "Comments": "This bright yellow bolete is a uncommon and striking find. Unusual for boletes in our area, it appears before the fall rains, perhaps utilizing moisture from the dying roots of Monterey pine stumps near which it fruits. Thiers originally described this species as having red pores, but later amended the description to cover a variant that has yellowish to yellowish-brown pores. Most sporocarps start with yellowish pores that turn reddish in age. Local material fits the amended description. An interesting aspect of this mushroom is that fresh material bruises blue quickly, but at maturity, the bluing reaction becomes faint or nonexistent."

    "Comments": "Commonly known as the Brain Mushroom because of its much wrinkled, typically reddish-brown cap, Gyromitra esculenta is one of the more distinctive members of the \"False Morel\" group. Nonetheless, it is sometimes confused with morels ( Morchella spp.) The latter are easily distinguished by their longitudinally ridged, pitted caps. Although the species name suggests edibility, Gyromitra esculenta is a questionable choice for the table as it contains monomethylhydrazine (MMH), a volatile toxin which in high doses can be fatal. Anecdotal evidence and preliminary tests by Duffy and Vergeer suggest that California material may not contain high levels of MMH, but caution is still advised. Although we cannot recommend eating this mushroom, it is commonly consumned in the Western United states. If you do try Gyromitra esculenta , it should always be cooked in a well ventilated area to avoid breathing any monomethylhydrazine that might be present and the cooking liquid should be discarded."

A more commonly collected cousin, Rickenella fibula has a yellowish-orange cap and stipe. Rickenella swartzii is most likely to be confused with Lichenomphalia umbellifera , commonly known as Omphalina ericetorum. This basidiomycete lichen (algae occur within its tissues) has a brownish to yellowish-brown, striate cap, but lacks the strong contrasting colors and finely pubescent surface of Rickenella swartzii. It also differs in its fruiting habit, typically on algae-covered rotting wood and soil. Compare also with Mycena species which can usually be distinguished by adnate to adnexed gills."

Both species occur under coast liveoak ( Quercus agrifolia ) but at different seasons, Amanita phalloides in the fall, A. ocreata in the late winter and spring. Unlike the Death Cap, Amanita ocreata is seldom abundant which probably explains why relatively few Bay Area mushroom poisonings have been attributed to it. Amanita ocreata is a large, attractive mushroom recognized by a cream-colored, non-striate cap, bulbous base subtended by a thin, white membranous volva , and a fragile, white annulus. Dilute potassium hydroxide, which yellows the cap cuticle and context, will help to confirm an identification. Look-alikes include pale specimens of Volvariella speciosa , a harmless mushroom distinguished by the lack of an annulus and salmon-pink spores, and white forms of Amanita lanei and A. velosa. The latter two species are edible but should be avoided by all but the experts because of possible confusion with Amanita ocreata and A. phalloides."

    "Comments": "Inocybe pallidicremea is a small lilac colored Inocybe with a silky fibrillose, umbonate cap. In the San Francisco Bay area it occurs most commonly under Monterey pine ( Pinus radiata ), but can also be found with other conifers. Historically it has been known as Inocybe geophylla var. lilacina or Inocybe lilacina. The name change to Inocybe pallidicremea results from molecular and morphological studies by Matheny that indicate the names I. lilacina or I. geophylla var. lilacina have been misapplied to at least 3 similar lilac tinged species in the United States. The most common and widespread of these is now correctly named Inocybe pallidicremea described above. The ârealâ Inocybe lilacina appears to be restricted to the eastern U.S. and differs from I. pallidicremea by smaller size and a persistently purple cap. Another California Inocybe , previous called I. lilacina , has now been described as new— Inocybe ionocephala. It is also found with conifers and differs from I. pallidicremea with a noticeably thicker white stipe, up to 10 mm broad, and paler lilac cap. Finally, another Inocybe , I. sublilacinus is morphologically almost identical to I. pallidicremea and is currently known from collections in Colorado and the northeastern U.S. It is told apart by slightly larger, more elliptical vs amygdaliform spores. The name Inocybe pallidicremea seems curious for a lavender species, but is understandable when one considers how quickly the lilac color fades to buff or pale tan, the stage that was likely used for a description. Inocybe pallidicremea should be compared with a number of lilac to purple colored mushrooms. These include a few distantly related Inocybes with lilac tinged caps but overall are brownish, fibrillose to squamulose, not silky fibrillose. Less likely to be confused are Clitocybe nuda and several Cortinarius species which while similar in color, are much larger."

The correct name for the taxon found in the United States is Chroogomphus ochraceus. In the San Francisco Bay Area, it and Chroogomphus vinicolor occur commonly under Pinus radiata (Monterey pine). The macroscopic differences between these two species are subtle. Predictably they are often confused, although it is possible with practice to identify young to nearly mature specimens. Chroogomphus ochraceus in general, has caps that incorporate greyish tones, e.g. grey-brown to vinaceous-grey-brown, while those of Chroogomphus vinicolor are consistently brown: e.g. dark mahogany-brown to rust-brown, usually over an orange background. Both species tend to become an ambiguous, dark vinaceous color in age. An interesting difference between the two species is their association with a companion Suillus species. In the San Francisco Bay Area, Chroogomphus ochraceus fruits under Monterey pine with Suillus fuscotomentosus , while Chroogomphus vinicolor fruits with Suillus pungens. Microscopically the two species can be told apart by their cystidia which are thin-walled in Chroogomphus ochraceus and thick-walled in Chroogomphus vinicolor."

Remnants of old specimens, small greyish tan cups, often persist in grass long after the spore case has disintegrated. Vascellum lloydianum often fruits in the company of two other small puffballs: Bovista plumbea and Bovista aestivalis. These can usually be distinguished at a glance by their subglobose shape and lack of a well-developed sterile base (section if in doubt). Vascellum lloydianum is closely related to, and some researchers believe conspecific, with Vascellum pratense. Recent DNA research places the latter within Lycoperdon , where it has been transferred.

Boletus edulis differs additionally in having a cap margin that slightly overlaps the tube layer. Another edible, robust bolete found in mixed woods is Boletus appendiculatus , (Butter Bolete). This rusty-brown to yellowish-brown capped bolete gets its common name from a yellowish, often reticulate stipe, and yellow pores that blue rapidly when bruised."

    "Comments": "Because this large, beautiful, and edible mushroom could be mistaken for Amanita phalloides (death cap), only collectors with years of local experience should consider it for the table. Amanita calyptroderma is recognized by a combination of characters: an orange-brown cap (in the typical form), with a thick white universal veil patch and conspicuously striate margin, hollow stipe, and a thick white volva cup which stands erect from stipe. Amanita phalloides when young and fresh has a yellowish-green to yellowish-brown, smooth cap, the universal veil patch usually thin and appressed, the cap margin not striate or obscurely so, the stipe usually solid, not hollow, and the volva, thin and membranous. While the differences between these two species are considerable, it should be noted that in age they become less obvious, thus mistakes can and have happened."

    "Comments": "Like other members of the genus Scleroderma , S. cepa has a thick, tough peridium. This character along with a firm, dark-purple gleba that is never soft, or semi-liquid, helps to separate it from members of the \"true puffballs,\" i.e. Calvatia , Lycoperdon , etc. The common name \"earthball\" comes from the tendency of this and several other Sclerodermas to be only partially erumpent. Many are found by troweling in areas where a single fruiting body has been exposed. Scleroderma cepa is characterized by a smooth, white peridium that becomes pinkish-brown, to ochraceous-brown, dark brown where handled or in age. The surface is then often cracked or areolate, but not with raised warts as is the case in Scleroderma citrinum which can be further distinguished by reticulate rather than spiny spores."

Harmaja (1976), transferred it to Pseudorhizina citing a number of morphological and chemical differences, the most obvious being a ribbed cap with a tomentose undersurface, pinkish stipe, and smaller spores with oil drops that are variable in size and number. Recent DNA evidence shows that is species is nested within Gyromitra and belongs there. Gyromitra sphaerospora of Eastern North America is very similar, differing as the species suggests, by globose spores."

    "Edibility": "Unknown.",
    "Comments": "Mycena citrinomarginata is a chameleon-like species, varying in color from yellow to brown and occupying habitats from grass to forest. Whether these differences are genetic and represent ecotypes (three varieties have been described) or responses to environmental factors, is a subject of debate. The above description fits what is most commonly found in the San Francisco Bay Area where it fruits in grassy areas, usually close to trees. In this habitat it is characterized by conic-obtuse caps that are brown at the disc, shading to a lighter margin, and gill edges that are pinkish brown to light brown. A radish-like odor is also a useful field-mark. Montane forms typically have a yellowish cap and yellowish marginate gills, the basis of the species epithet. Complicating matters is another Mycena , M. olivaceomarginata. With cap colors that overlap with those of Mycena citrinomarginata and similar micromorphology, it may be conspecific. If confirmed by molecular study, then M. citrinomarginata , an older name, has priority. In coastal and montane forests, yellowish fruitings of Mycena citrinomarginata should be compared with M. epipterygia , a yellowish to yellow-olivaceous cap species that has a viscid, not moist cap, and non-marginate gills. The brown form of Mycena citrinomarginata bears a resemblance to a number of forest Mycenas, perhaps the most similar, Mycena galopus. It, however, lacks marginate gills, a radish odor, and exudes a milky juice at the base of the stipe when injured."

This feature and a preference for fruiting on or near rotting wood are important but not infallible fieldmarks. Similar colored Pezizas are unfortunately common. Most require a microscope to identify with certainty. Several reported to occur in California are listed below. Peziza varia mimics Peziza repanda with a spreading form and association with rotting wood, but differs in its smaller, greyish-brown ascocarps, and microscopically with septate paraphyses, and a strongly stratified context. Peziza arvernensis , (= Peziza sylvestris ), has an ochre-brown hymenium, lighter-colored, slightly furfuraceous exterior, finely warted spores, and fruiting habit on soil and decaying wood. Peziza domiciliana is found on old masonry, rotting textiles, and sandy soils. It forms a tan to ochre-brown cup, sometimes with pinkish to vinaceous tints, has smooth spores, and septate paraphyses; Peziza badia has a dark-brown hymenium with a dingy reddish-brown, pustulate, outer surface, remains cupulate at maturity, has roughened to sculptured spores with 1-2 oil droplets, and occurs on soil in woods; Peziza vesiculosa is an ochre-brown species distinctive for its urn shape at maturity and preference for fruiting on straw enriched with horse and cow dung. Furrowed specimens of Peziza repanda should also be compared with Discina perlata , a snowbank species which bears a resemblance, but differs in a relatively thick, blunt margin and usually short, stout stipe."

    "Comments": "Russula cantharellicola is one of several dingy Russulas that redden or blacken with handling or in age. These include Russula densifolia , R. nigricans and R. dissimulans , whose tissues bruise reddish, then go grey to black, and Russula albonigra and R. atrata that blacken directly without an intermediate reddish stage. Russula cantharellicola is distinct from all of the above in that its cap and gill tissue only redden, sometimes darkening to red-brown or grey-brown, but never to black. It should be noted that these color changes occur slowly sometimes taking up to 15 minutes to a half hour. Russula cantharellicola often fruits close to yellow chanterelles, and is used by some collectors as an indicator species, much like Amanita muscaria is with Boletus edulis."

    "Comments": "Choiromyces alveolatus is an uncommon Ascomycete truffle (at least for humans), though not necessarily for rodents who locate the fruiting bodies with their superior sense of smell. Its appearance, knobby and brown, with a strong odor at maturity is suggestive of the genus Tuber to which it is in fact closely related. It differs microscopically, however, with asci that are arranged in a palisade at maturity and spores that are dimpled like a golf ball. Tuber species in contrast tend to have spiny to reticulate spores and asci that are more or less randomly arranged. Molecular studies confirm these differences. Two Tuber species that can be confused with Choiromyces alveolatus are T. gibbosum and T. oregonense , the Oregon White Truffles. These commercially collected species differ subtly at maturity with fruiting bodies that tend to develop reddish tinges or blotches, especially Tuber oregonense. Additionally, both species are strongly associated with Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ), while Choiromyces alveolatus has a broader host preference, occurring with a variety of conifers."

    "Comments": "An unusual fruiting habit, on the decayed remains of Helvella lacunosa , helps distinguish this small drab mushroom. The typically clustered fruitings grow from a sclerotium, a mass of partially differentiated tissue which includes stipe remnants of a Helvella lacunosa. These are best seen by sectioning a sclerotium. Members of the Collybia racemosa , C. tuberosa group also fruit on decayed mushrooms, but are smaller, less robust, fruit from a grain-sized sclerotium, and do not occur with Helvella lacunosa. Collybia racemosa is particularly distinctive in having a stipe with slender side branches. Also compare with Inocybe geophylla , a similar-sized, whitish mushroom sometimes found under Monterey pine ( Pinus radiata ) with Helvella lacunosa. The latter is separable by a spermatic odor, a dull-brown spore print, and a sparse fibrillose veil."

    "Comments": "A lilac-tinged cap margin and stipe are helpful though not definitive fieldmarks of Inocybe griseolilacina. To distinguish it from similar species requires a combination of characters and preferably young, fresh specimens. Inocybe griseolilacina is recognized by its appressed-fibrillose to slightly squamulose cap which is medium-brown at the disk, shading lighter brown and lilac-tinged towards the margin, the latter fringed in youth. Microscopic features include smooth spores, fusoid-ventricose to lageniform thick-walled, hyaline pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia, as well as the absence of caulocystidia. Of the lilac-colored Inocybes one is likely to encounter, Inocybe geophylla var. lilacina is easiest to recognize because of its silky-fibrillose cap which is entirely lilac when young except for a brownish disc. Inocybe pusio bears a strong resemblance to I. griseolilacina but its cap is uniformly brown and fibrillose with only the upper third of the stipe lilac. Another Inocybe with lilac to violaceous tones is Inocybe cincinnata (= I. phaeocomis ). The two varieties of this species have scaly brown caps, also with only the upper portion of the stipe typically lilac. Microscopically they differ in possessing thick, yellow-walled pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia as well as brown, incrusted paracystidia interspersed among the cheilocystidia; additionally, caulocystidia are present only at the extreme apex of the stipe."

    "Spores": "Spores 8-10 x 3.5-5 µm, smooth, elongate-elliptical; spore print pinkish-buff.",
    "Habitat": "Scattered to grouped on standing dead conifers or fallen timber; fruiting from mid to late winter.",
    "Edibility": "Too tough to considered for the table.",
    "Comments": "This unusual polypore looks like a puffball growing on wood. However, sectioning the woody fruiting body (a sturdy blade or saw is required) reveals an internal tube layer typical of polypores. Insects, mostly beetles, help disperse the spores by chewing holes in the veil-like membrane that covers the tube layer and by carrying spores to other dead trees."

    "Edibility": "Edible with caution. Prized by many, this species is also known to occasionally cause gastrointestinal upsets. This appears to be caused by eating old and/or insufficiently cooked specimens. If you decide to try it, eat only the young, fresh, growing margins, in small quantities, and cook it thoroughly.",
    "Comments": "Laetiporus conifericola can be distinguished by its bright orange to orangish yellow, shelving fruitbodies with a sulphur-yellow pore surface, and as the epithet implies, occurs only on conifers. Laetiporus conifericola is one of two species of sulphur shelf or chicken of the woods mushrooms that occur in California. The nearly indistinguishable Laetiporus gilbertsonii grows on a variety of hardwoods, principally eucalyptus and oak. Specimens of both species that overwinter turn white and become chalky and crumbly."

The caps of Clitocybe glacialis have a silvery-grey bloom, a feature lacking in Melanoleuca angelesiana. Additionally, Clitocybe glacialis has a dense mycelial mat at the base of the stipe, while in Melanoleuca angelesiana the mycelium is comparatively sparse. These features become less obvious in age at which time a microscope may be needed to confirm an identification. The spores of Melanoleuca angelesiana are warted and amyloid, while those of Clitocybe glacialis are smooth and inamyloid.

    "Comments": "Traditionally known as Leucoagaricus naucinus , most mycologists now regard this name as a synonym of Leucoagaricus leucothites / Leucocoprinus leucothites , which has nomenclatural priority. Fieldmarks include a whitish, glabrous cap, sometimes tinged buff to pale-grey, gills that are tinged pinkish at maturity, and a sub-bulbous stipe that bruises yellowish to brown on handling. Beginning mycophagists should avoid this species because of its resemblance to deadly white Amanitas. In our area this would include the white form of Amanita phalloides as well as Amanita ocreata. These two Amanitas can be distinguished by the presence of a sac-like volva and a membranous, fixed ring. Two other mushrooms occasionally confused with Leucoagaricus naucinus are Volvariella speciosa and Agaricus campestris. Volvariella speciosa typically fruits in disturbed habitats, e.g. iceplant, agricultural fields etc. It has pinkish, free gills, but has a volva and lacks a veil. Agaricus campestris has pinkish, free gills which become blackish-brown at maturity. Additionally it has a poorly developed, evanescent ring."

Like all Pluteus species it is characterized by free gills that mature pinkish-brown, the lack of a partial or universal veil, and occurrence on lignicolous substrates. Unfortunately, the principal fieldmarks, a greyish-brown, appressed fibrillose cap and fibrillose-striate stipe, are common to several Pluteus species in California. Of these, Pluteus cervinus is the most similar. No single character distinguishes the two species, rather a number of characters are needed to make an identification. Typically the cap of Pluteus cervinus is more uniformly brown than that of P. pouzarianus which is often greyish-brown. A more significant difference is the nature of the cuticle. In Pluteus pouzarianus the cuticle is two-layered, the upper layer consisting of erect, nearly hyaline, hyphae over a lower strata of repent brown hyphae. The result is a cap disc that has a faint whitish bloom (use hand lens). Pluteus cervinus in contrast differs in possessing surface disc hyphae that are typically brown. Microscopically, Pluteus pouzarianus possesses clamp connections, these usually absent in P. cervinus. Finally, Pluteus pouzarianus has a weak rhaphanoid odor, compared to strong in P. cervinus. Pluteus atromarginatus , another brown capped species, is more easily identified because of dark gill edges, a feature not seen in Pluteus pouzarianus or P. cervinus."

    "Edibility": "Edible and excellent.",
    "Comments": "Cantharellus formosus is a medium-sized chanterelle that is distinguished by a yellowish orange to salmon-colored cap that develops grayish brown tones in age, decurrent gill folds that are often tinged pink, a slender stipe, pleasant fruity odor, and habit with conifers, especially Sitka spruce and Douglas fir along our northern coast. It is the most important commercially collected chanterelle in the Pacific Northwest. Other chanterelles found in California include Cantharellus californicus , Cantharellus roseocanus , and Cantharellus subalbidus. C. californicus , common in oak woodlands, is distinguished its evenly yellow coloration, chunky stature, and large size; C. roseocanus is associated with conifers (Sitka spruce, Bishop pine) and has bright orangish yellow gill folds and a cap margin that often has a pink bloom; C. subalbidus is whiteish to cream overall and associated with Douglas fir, pine, and madrone. Omphalotus olivascens , a toxic species, may be confused with chanterelles, but it has well-developed, thin, plate-like gills, olive tones to cap and gills, grows in clusters on wood, and is bioluminescent."

Indeed, Verpa bohemica is sometimes sold in markets under the name \"Spring Morel\" or \"Early Morel,\" though it lacks both the texture and flavor of true morels ( Morchella spp.). Morels, (except for Morchella semilibera ) can easily be told from Verpa bohemica by a cap margin that is fused (not free) to the stipe. The exception to the rule, Morchella semilibera , has a cap that is fused approximately halfway to the apex."

    "Comments": "Phaeoclavulina myceliosa is a short, cream to ochre-colored coral fungus, conspicuous for the arcs and rings it often forms in conifer duff. The lack of a central stipe, bitter taste, and development from a thick mycelial bed are additional characters that help separate it from similar coral fungi. These include Phaeoclavulina abietina , also common in arcs under conifers such as Monterey cypress, but more olivaceous, with a tendency to bruise bluish-green at the base; Lentaria pinicola , a short, well-branched, dull yellow to ochre coral found typically on dead conifer branches, e.g. Douglas fir, with smooth spores up to 9 microns long; Lentaria byssiseda , a small shrubby species found on woody debris with a short stipe, pinkish-tan branches, the tips lighter, occasionally greenish, and narrow, smooth spores up to 12 microns long. Phaeoclavulina myceliosa should also be compared with another small common coral fungus, Clavulina cristata. The latter fruits gregariously in pine duff, especially that of Monterey pine ( Pinus radiata ), but is paler, often cream-colored, and does not develop from a thick mycelial bed. Microscopically, its basidia are two-spored, the spores smooth, not spinulose."

    "Edibility": "Edibility unknown; insignificant.",
    "Comments": "Like many dung fungi, Cheilymenia fimicola and a close relative, Cheilymenia stercorea , are cosmopolitan species, found wherever cows and horses are pastured. Both are small orange cups with bristle-like marginal hairs, but with subtle differences. In Cheilymenia fimicola the hairs are straight, septate, tapered to a point, and branched only at the base. Cheilymenia stercorea in contrast, has two types of hairs, some straight, tapered, and septate like Cheilymenia fimicola , though usually darker, plus shorter, stellate-branched hairs found mostly at the base of the apothecia. A third Cheilymenia , found occasionally on horse manure, Cheilymenia theleboloides , is pale-yellowish and has inconspicuous, nearly hyaline hairs. Other look-alikes include Coprobia granulata and Scutellinia scutellata. The former produces orange cups on dung, but lacks marginal hairs, and as the species epithet suggests, has a roughened exterior. Scutellinia scutellata is a bright-orange cup with conspicuous marginal hairs, but occurs on rotting wood, not dung."

    "Comments": "California is home to many greyish-brown Mycenas, most of which are difficult to identify without a microscope. Mycena galopus is an exception. It is the only known Mycena in California that exudes a milky juice when tissues such as the base of the stipe are cut or injured. Unfortunately, this feature may be faint or absent in older specimens. Lacking milky juice, a helpful macroscopic character is a bicolored cap, dark at the disk, shading to a pale margin. Interestingly, the contrasting cap colors are the basis of the species epithet for a synonym of Myena galopus , i.e. Mycena fusco-ocula. Mycena galopus is a cosmopolitan species, found not only along the Pacific Coast, but also in the eastern US, Europe, and Japan."

    "Comments": "Kavinia alboviridis can be distinguished by a thin, loose, white cottony layer with pendent yellowish olive spines, on which are formed warted greenish yellow spores. Interestingly, this odd fungus is related to the coral fungus Lentaria in order Gomphales. Steccherinum fimbriatum forms a tough, membranous crust with wart-like grayish pink to vinaceous buff spines; additional characters include dimitic-skeletal tissues, thick-walled crystal-incrusted hymenial cystidia, and smooth white spores. Steccherinum ochraceum is a similar crust fungus but forms thin, overlapping, zonate, leathery gray to ochre shelves with orange to salmon spines."

Another puffball sometimes found with Lycoperdon subcretaceum is Calvatia fumosa. Similar in size and shape, it differs with a noticeably thicker peridium and an areolate surface of flat, not erect, brownish warts. It is unusual among puffballs in developing a strong, unpleasant odor as it nears maturity, evident when sectioned. Calbovista subsculpta , a much larger montane puffball, is unlikely to be confused except for small, immature specimens. These can be distinguished by a well-develop subgleba and a thick cord-like anchoring root, both features poorly developed in Lycoperdon subcretaceum."

    "Comments": "A small puffball of grassy areas, Lycoperdon curtisii is recognized by a clustered fruiting habit and exoperidium of spines arranged in groups with fused tips. Microscopically, a helpful although not definitive character, is a gleba composed almost entirely of paracapillitium and relatively small, nearly smooth spores. Lycoperdon curtisii can be confused with a number of small puffballs. Bovista species such as B. plumbea , B. aestivalis , and B. dermoxantha are similar in size and shape but lack conspicuous grouped spines. Lycoperdon ( Vascellum ) pratense , when small, resembles L. curtisii , but the exoperidium is covered with a mixture of relatively scattered thin, recurved spines and fufuraceous granules which become ochre-colored in age. In addition, Vascellum pratense has a well developed subgleba separated frm the gleba by a flat to concave, not convex-umbonate diaphragm. Lycoperdon marginatum is also similar when young with an exoperdium of fused pointed spines and warts, but these fall away in large plates rather than singly or in small groups. Additionally the subgleba and gleba are not separated by a diaphragm, and the gleba is dominated by true capillitium. Most easily distinguished is a small montane puffball, Calvatia subcretacea. It possesses an exoperidium of pointed warts, but the tips are greyish to light-brown, and a subgleba is absent."

    "Comments": "The funnel-form caps of Coltricia perennis typically have well-defined bands of colors, these ranging from cinnamon-brown, yellow-brown to grey. Important identifying features are a tomentose cap surface and a usually decurrent tube layer. The closely related Coltricia cinnamomea has a faintly-zoned, reddish-brown fruiting body. The cap suface of Coltricia cinnamomea is covered with appressed fibrils rather than a tomentum. These fibrils sometimes give the species a shiny or glistening appearance. Look-alikes of Coltricia perennis include stipitate species of Polyporus , e.g. P. elegans , P. varius , etc. These can be told apart by their lignicolous habit and non rusty-brown context. Also similar are species of Hydnellum and Phellodon which have leathery, zonate caps, but are toothed, not pored. Finally, Ionotus tomentosus is another terrestrial, stipitate polypore, but it can be distinguished by a relatively thick, indistinctly-zoned cap and microscopically by the presence of setae."

When fresh the caps are olivaceous, albeit only briefly, as they soon become brown with age and drying. A DNA-ITS sequence of specimens from the Bullards Bar area (Yuba Co.) indicates a close relationship (99% similarity) with Conocybe gigasperma , a European taxa. Arguing against conspecific status, however, are significant morphological differences, notably the nature of the cap and spores. Local material possess a rivulose to rugulose cap, a character not described for C. gigasperma ; spores have a central germ pore vs eccentric germ pore in Conocybe gigasperma , and the spores of the local species are shorter, up to 18 Âµm versus 27 Âµm long in C. gigasperma. More collections and sequences are needed to clarify the taxonomic status of this possibly undescribed Conocybe. It should be noted in addition to Conocybe gigasperma , at least 3 other greenish capped Conocybe species are known from Europe and Russia. Conocybe aeruginosa differs with a cap that is described as bluish green, not olive. Conocybe cyanopus has blue green tints that are restricted to the stipe, and a recently described Russian species, Conocybe olivaceopileata when fresh, has a ochre brown, olivaceous tinged, glabrous, not rivulose or rugose cap, slightly wider spaced gills, and narrower spores."

    "Comments": "Mycenas are among the earliest mushrooms to fruit and one of the most common under oak is Mycena californiensis. It is recognized by a reddish-brown cap, marginate gills, a hairy-stipe base that bleeds reddish juice, and oak duff habit. Several other Mycenas resemble this species including Mycena purpureofusca , a marginate-gilled form of Mycena haematopus , and M. sanguinolenta. Mycena purpureofusca is distinguished by a purple-brown, not orange-brown cap, a stipe that does not bleed reddish juice, and a preference for fruiting on pine cones (sometimes buried). Mycena haematopus also has a differently colored cap, vinaceous to pinkish-brown, rather than reddish-brown, has a distinctive scalloped, hairy-capped margin, and is found on rotting wood. Mycena sanguinolenta is very similar to M. californiensis and until recently was the name used for this taxon. However, according to Brian Perry, who is monographing California Mycenas, Mycena sanguinolenta is a distinct species differing from M. californiensis microscopically and in substrate preference. Its fruiting substrate is believed to be rotting wood and debris of Douglas fir and coast redwood. Perry has also determined that Mycena elegantula , a name that has been applied in California to vinaceous-capped marginate-gilled Mycenas, is a synonym of Mycena californiensis."

In age the cap color fades to pinkish-brown and much of the bloom disappears, but it is still recognizable by a pungent, radish-like odor, often wavy cap, and a fibrillose-squamulose stipe. A second form collected regularly in the Sierra typically has an ochre-brown cap with a pale margin. This is similar to the concept of many European mycologists. Of necessity, the above description has been written broadly to encompass both forms. In coastal areas, Hebeloma sinapizans is most likely to be confused with reddish-brown Tricholomas, notably Tricholoma muricatum and Tricholoma fracticum with which it sometimes fruits under Monterey pine ( Pinus radiata ). These species, like Hebeloma sinapizans , are thought to be toxic and should be avoided."

Although they both belong in the Agaricaceae, molecular studies suggest that they are not as close as once thought, a notion supported by their dissimilar natural histories. Podaxis pistillaris differs from Coprinus comatus with its persistent fruiting bodies and secotioid habit, i.e. a cap that typically remains closed through development, protecting the fertile tissue from dessication. Gills and forcible spore discharge are replaced by a puffball-like gleba, and the spores, which are double-walled, presumably also an adaptation to xeric conditions, are released only when cracks form in the senescent fruiting bodies. In contrast, Coprinus comatus, a moisture-loving species, produces short-lived, fleshy fruiting bodies with gills that soon deliquesce into an inky liquid, helping to liberate the single-walled spores."

    "Description": "For description see Redhead et al. & 'California Mushrooms'.",
    "Habitat": "Solitary to gregarious, often in small clusters, on mossy soil or in leaf litter under conifers (Sitka spruce, hemlock, fir); locally common, fruiting from fall through mid-winter in the North Coast, Sierra Nevada, and Cascade Ranges.",
    "Edibility": "Edible and excellent.",
    "Comments": "Cantharellus roseocanus can be distinguished by young caps covered with a pinkish buff bloom juxtaposed with peachy orange to bright orange gill folds. By far, it forms the most brilliantly pigmented hymenophore of any California chanterelle. In the protologue , the authors provided a common name, rainbow chanterelle, because “it sports an array of colors, it occurs in rain forests, and at its end it is golden.” It often grows in the same habitats as Cantharellus formosus , but the latter forms caps that lack a pinkish buff bloom and develop grayish brown shades in age, has paler gill folds usually with pink tones, and readily bruises yellow to ochraceous."

The presence of an annulus and creamy-yellow disc are important fieldmarks that help to separate it from the very similar Coprinopsis cordisporus. The latter, which often fruits with C. ephemeroides , lacks a ring, and has cap granules that tend to be tan to cinnamon-brown. Two additional species should be mentioned, Coprinus patouillardii and Coprinus cardiasporus. The former is regarded by some authors as conspecific with C. cordisporus , but may differ in slightly larger size, substrate preference (plant matter rather than dung), along with subtle microscopic differences. Coprinus cardiasporus , a name confusingly similar to C. cordisporus is also a small, dung dwelling species with a granulose cap. It is differentiated largely on microscopic grounds, the most obvious one being the spores which although heart-shaped in face-view are not angular or pentagonal as in the other species."
