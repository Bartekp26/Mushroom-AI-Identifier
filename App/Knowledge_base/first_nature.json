      "description": "This wood-rotting fungus sometimes forms very attractive rosettes - and some people refer to it as the Blushing Rosette - but more often it grows as an amorphous mass of irregular maze-like pores exuding blobs of red-brown juice that eventually dry to leave brown stains of the pore surface.",
      "distribution": "Although an infrequent find, this wood-rotting fungus occurs throughout Britain and Ireland as well as in many parts of mainland Europe and North America.",
      "taxonomic history": "In 1789, when French mycologist Jean Baptiste Francois Pierre Bulliard described this species, he gave it the binomial scientific name Boletus biennis. The currently-accepted name Abortiporus biennis dates from a 1944 publication by German-American mycologist Rolf Singer.",

      "description": "Roadside verges and permanent pasture are places where you will see this large, edible fungus - although if gathering mushrooms to eat it is not a good idea to include roadside specimens. Beware also of a toxic lookalike, the Yellow Stainer, which is also fond of roadside grassy habitats and can cause serious stomach upsets if included in a mushroom meal. Agaricus arvensis, the Horse Mushroom, first appears in summer, and these large fungi usually continue fruiting until the end of autumn.",
      "distribution": "Fairly frequent in Britain and Ireland as well as in most countries of mainland Europe and parts of Asia and North America, the Horse Mushroom has also been reported from Australia (where it is sometimes referred to as the Almond Mushroom) as well as New Zealand.",
      "identification": {
        "Odour/taste": "Taste not distinctive. Strong odour of aniseed. (The rather similar Yellow Stainer has an unpleasant phenolic or inky odour - a useful way of distinguishing between the edible Horse Mushroom, which also bruises slightly yellow, and that toxic toadstool Agaricus xanthodermus.)",
        "Habitat & Ecological role": "Agaricus arvensis appears in manured meadows and beside bridle paths and other places where there is plenty of decaying organic matter, upon which it feeds saprophytically. The Horse Mushroom is one of the largest and most distinctive fungi in its genus, often forms fairy rings many metres in diameter in permanent pastures.",
        "Season": "August to November, typically a week or two later than the Field Mushroom, Agaricus campestris, with which the Horse Mushroom is sometimes confused.",
        "Similar species": "The poisonous Yellow Stainer, Agaricus xanthodermus, quickly turns bright chrome yellow when cut or bruised, and it smells of iodine or ink rather than of aniseed. Agaricus urinascens var. urinascens (syn. Agaricus macrosporus) is very similar in appearance but does not turn bright chrome yellow when cut or bruised.; it grows in open grassland and in woodland clearings. The specific epithet of its older synonym refers to the large (for an Agaricus species) size of the spores this mushroom - typically 11 x 6µm - which also distinguishes it from the Yellow Stainer."

Amanita caesarea (Caesar's Mushroom) is rarely if ever found except in southern Europe; its cap is brilliant orange with a striated margin, and the stipe is yellow - Blusher caps lack marginal striations and their stems are not yellow, although there is a form - Amanita rubescens f. annulosulfurea (Gillet) Lange - that has a yellow stem ring.

In Britain this is a very rare find, although it may be more common than records suggest: despite its large size (specimens 25cm tall are not unusual) its 'dry stick' appearance does little to attract attention.",

      "description": "Clathrus ruber is a remarkable species, almost certainly introduced rather than native to northern Europe. When seen for the first time it is often assumed to be something other than a fungus. Like the common stinkhorn and the dog stinkhorn, this 'cage stinkhorn' emerges from a white ball or 'egg' - and like other members of this family the egg is said to be edible. I have never met anyone who can confirm that from first-hand experience, and there are other reports saying that eating Red Cage eggs can cause serious gastric upsets.",

(Rea was one of the founding members of the British Mycological Society and served two terms as its president.) It was another British mycologist, Edred John Henry Corner (1906 - 1996), who in 1950 transferred this species to the genus Clavulinopsis, establishing its currently accepted scientific name as Clavulinopsis luteoalba.",

      "taxonomic history": "The Fluted Bird's Nest was described in 1778 by British mycologist William Hudson (1730 - 1793), who called it Peziza striata (effectively placing it within a group of ascomycete cup fungi, whereas this and the various other bird's nest fungi are, of course, basidiomycete species).

Well-rotted damp timber is the staple diet of the Fluted Bird's Nest fungus, whose fruitbodies can be seen from early summer through to the onset of winter.",

        "Similar species": "Cyathus stercoreus is very similar (its rim is not so widely flared, however) but its peridioles are much smaller; it is a dung-loving species (the specific epithet stercoreus means 'filth') but is also found on marram grass in coastal sand dunes. Several similar species occur throughout Europe. Cyathus olla (without ribbed nest walls) and Crucibulum laeve are fairly common (but equally hard to spot) in Britain and Ireland as well as on mainland Europe and further afield."

Hygrocybe coccinea is smaller, a paler red, and has a less fibrous reddish stem. Hygrocybe conica has a more pointed cap and yellow stem flesh;it turns black with age or when cut."

Being something of an oddball in terms of appearance and growing habit, it is perhaps unsurprising that there has been much debate about where this species sits in the taxonomic system. Rooting Shank has therefore acquired many other scientific names over the past 230 years. Its recent scientific name Xerula radicata dates from a 1995 publication by the German mycologist Heinrich Dörfelt (born 1940); however, in 2010 American mycologist Ron Petersen (b. 1934) circumscribed the new genus Hymenopellis with Hymenopellis radicata as the type species.",

Three other records of this beautiful mushroom in the Fungal Records Database for Britain and Ireland (FRDBI) were all made between 1999 and 2005 and are from Somerset (two sightings) in southwest England and Brecon (one sighting) in Wales.",
      "distribution": "There are insufficient records to describe meaningfully the distribution of this species in Britain and Ireland, but it is quite possible that its appearance in recent years may be due to climate change. This dapperling mushroom occurs in many parts of mainland Europe, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, but it seems to be an uncommon to rare find throughout its range.",
      "taxonomic history": "This lovely dapperling mushroom was described in 2000 by American mycologist Else C Velinga, who gave it the scientific name Leucoagaricus crystallifer by which it is generally known today.",
      "identification": {
        "Odour/taste": "Not significant.",
        "Habitat & Ecological role": "Saprobic, found either singly or in small groups in or at the edge of deciduous woodland.",

        "Similar species": "Most likely to be confused with small dapperlings of the Lepiota or Leucocoprinus genera, many of which are entirely or mainly white when young and fresh."

These pear-shaped fruitbodies are often seen swarming over dead stumps. (If they appear to be growing on soil this is not so but simply an indicator of buried trunks or branches.)",
      "distribution": "A widespread and very common find in Britain and Ireland, the Stump Puffball fruits most often in large, densely-packed groups on decaying tree stumps and sometimes on well-rotted fallen branches. Lycoperdon pyriforme is a worldwide fungus; its distribution includes mainland Europe and Asia as well as North America.",
      "taxonomic history": "This edible fungus of the forests was first described in scientific literature in 1796 by Jacob Christian Schaeffer, who gave it the binomial name Lycoperdon pyriforme. That name was subsequently ratified by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 and therefore remains its accepted scientific name today.",

Stump Puffballs may appear to be growing on soil, but there is always rotten wood or decaying woody debris just beneath the surface.

The Stinkhorn and the Morel have several features in common: their caps are pitted and roughly comparable in size, and quite often they are found in the same kinds of woodland habitats.

      "taxonomic history": "This oddball mushroom has confounded mycologists down the ages as they struggled to fit it in to existing genera. There has been much debate as to whether this mushroom should be considered a member of the Agaricaceae (grouped with field mushrooms and their kin, as we have it here); some suggest it has more in common with Pholiota species, which belong to the family Strophariaceae. Now placed in a genus all on its own (the technical term for this is 'monotypic'), the Golden Bootleg's basionym dates from 1779, when German botanist Heinrich Gottfried von Mattuschka (1734 - 1779) described this species and gave it the binomial name Agaricus aureus. (At the time most gilled mushrooms were placed in a gigantic Agaricus genus, who contents have since been largely redistributed across many newer genera.) It was not until 1928 that French mycologists Paul Konrad (1877 - 1948) and André Maublanc (1880 - 1958) renamed the Golden Bootleg as Phaeolepiota aurea, which remains its accepted scientific name.",

      "scientific name": "Tricholoma acerbum",
      "common name": "Reference Sources The Bitter Knight is one of the easiest of the Tricholoma species to identify in the field. Its large size and its pale ochre cap with and strongly inrolled margin are usually enough to convince anyone who has previously seen a few of these massive mushrooms. Distribution This conspicuous 'knight' is a rare sight in Britain and Ireland; however in central and southern mainland Europe and in North Africa and parts of Asia, wherever there is oak or sweet chestnut woodland, there is always a cance of stumbling across a few of these huge mushrooms. This striking Tricholoma species has also been reported from parts of North America, but experts say that it is doubtful whether these finds are truly co-specific with the European Tricholoma acerbum. Taxonomic history When Jean Baptiste Francois (Pierre) Bulliard described this woodland mushroom in 1792 he gave it the binomial scientific name Agaricus acerbus. (In the early days of fungus taxonomy most gilled fungi were placed into a gigantic Agaricus genus, since made more manageable by redistributing most of its contents to other new genera. The genus Agaricus now houses only the 'true mushrooms'.) Eighty years later, in 1872, French mycologist Lucien Quélet renamed this species Tricholoma acerbum, which is the name by which mycologists generally refer to it nowadays. The only synonyms of Tricholoma acerbum that I am aware of are Agaricus acerbus Bull., and Gyrophilus acerba Quél. Etymology Tricholoma was established as a genus by the great Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. The generic name comes from Greek words meaning 'hairy fringe', and it must be one of the least appropriate mycological genus names, because very few species within this genus have hairy or even shaggily scaly cap margins that would justify the descriptive term. The specific epithet acerbum means bitter, a reference to the taste of these chunky woodland mushrooms. Identification guide Cap Initially hemispherical, later convex or flattened but retaining a pronounced inrolled margin; usually dry and smooth; mostly yellowish buff, but often light tan towards the centre when mature; surface mostly smooth but with a ribbed margin; 7 to 14cm across. Gills Creamy white or pale yellowish; eventually developing reddish brown spots; crowded. Stem White to pale yellowish-buff, pruinose towards the apex and with a slightly swollen or occasonally bulbous base; cylindrical, often curved near base; 4 to 12cm long, 1 to 2cm diameter; no stem ring. Spores Broadly ellipsoidal or ovoid, smooth, 5-7 x 3.5-5μm; with a hilar appendage; inamyloid. Show larger image... Spores of Tricholoma acerbum Spore print White. Odour/taste Very slight fruity odour; taste usually sour (some say bitter and peppery). Note: this is reported to be a slightly poisonous species. Habitat & Ecological role Mycorrhizal, in calcareous broadleaf woodland, most often found under Quercus (oaks) and Sweet Chestnut trees. Season Usually July to October in Britain and Ireland, but if there are no heavy frosts then Bitter Knights can appear as late as November. Similar species Tricholoma roseocerba Riva is very similar in microscopic characteristics, but many authorities accept it as a separate species because of the pinkish tones in the cap surface.

(In the early days of fungus taxonomy most gilled fungi were placed into a gigantic Agaricus genus, since made more manageable by redistributing most of its contents to other new genera.

      "scientific name": "Tricholoma album",
      "common name": "Reference Sources Although not always a pure white (and never in shining armour), this is a very pale 'knight' and therefore easy to find against the dark background of a forest floor… unless it has been snowing. Distribution This neat and conspicuous mushroom can be found in both broadleaf and coniferous woodland. In Britain and Ireland this is rather an uncommon find, but in Scandinavia this species is abundant in the spruce forests that dominate the landscape. Tricholoma album occurs throughout mainland Europe, from northern Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean and the southern shores of the Iberian Peninsula, but its presence in North America is currently (autumn 2013) unconfirmed. Taxonomic history When Jacob Christian Schaeffer described this woodland mushroom in 1770 he gave it the binomial scientific name Agaricus albus. (In the early days of fungus taxonomy most gilled fungi were placed into a gigantic Agaricus genus, since made more manageable by redistributing most of its contents to other new genera. The genus Agaricus now houses only the 'true mushrooms'.) A century later, in 1871, German mycologist Paul Kummer renamed this species Tricholoma album, which is the name by which mycologists generally refer to it nowadays. Synonyms of Tricholoma album include Agaricus albus Schaeff., and Tricholoma raphanicum P. Karst. Etymology Tricholoma was established as a genus by the great Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. The generic name comes from Greek words meaning 'hairy fringe', and it must be one of the least appropriate mycological genus names, because very few species within this genus have hairy or even shaggily scaly cap margins that would justify the descriptive term. The specific epithet album is not at all difficult to unscramble: it means white. Identification guide Cap Initially conical with an inrolled margin, later convex or flattened with small umbo and usually a wavy margin; usually dry and smooth; white or with a pale yellow tinge, ochre-yellow towards the centre when mature; smooth; 4 to 10cm across. Gills White or pale yellow; with coarsely toothed edges; of uneven lengths and moderately distant; sinuate (notched very close to the stem). Stem White to pale yellowish-brown, pruinose towards the apex and often with fine longitudinal fibrils near the base; cylindrical; 3 to 6cm long, 0.8 to 1.5cm diameter; no stem ring. Spores Broadly ellipsoidal, smooth, 5-7 x 3.5-4.5μm; with a pronounced hilar appendage; inamyloid. Show larger image... Spores of Tricholoma album Spore print White. Odour/taste Strong odour of radish when crushed; slight taste of radish. (Note: this is a poisonous species.) Habitat & Ecological role Mycorrhizal, in broadleaf and coniferous woodland. Season Usually June to October in Britain and Ireland, but if there are no heavy frosts then White Knights can appear as late as November and even into December. Similar species Tricholoma stiparophyllum is very similar in macroscopic characteristics, but with a strong and unpleasant sickly-sweet odour; there are also small differences in the microscopic characters of these two mushrooms, which some authorities currently treat them as the same species. Culinary Notes The White Knight is known to be toxic and should definitely not be collected for the pot. Even when thoroughly cooked these chunky mushrooms cause serious gastric upsets if they are eaten.

      "scientific name": "Tricholoma cingulatum",
      "common name": "Reference Sources Although many greyish-brown Tricholoma fungi are difficult to identify from macroscopic characters alone, the Girdled Knight is not one of these. A finely scaly grey-brown cap plus a distinct ring on the stem are key features. Microscopically, it is unusual in having narrow oval spores, whereas most fungi in this genus have broader oval spores. This mycorrhizal mushroom is found with various kinds of willows, including Dwarf Willow in the slacks on some sand-dune systems. Distribution In Britain and Ireland this is one of the less common of the 'knights', but it has been recorded in a number of locations in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England, often in quite large groups. The Girdled Knight is quite common in Scandinavia, and it has been found also in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and many other countries on mainland Europe. Taxonomic history The basionym of this species dates from an 1830 publication in Linnaea by Elias Magnus Fries wherein Amfelt's binomial scientific name for this species was recorded as Agaricus cingulatus. (In the early days of fungus taxonomy, most of the gilled mushrooms were included initially in the genus Agaricus, but the majority have since been relocated in newer genera to leave only the 'true mushroom' in the Agaricus genus.) The currently-accepted scientific name Tricholoma cingulatum dates from an 1890 publication, wherein E. Jacobashch (about whom I have no biographical information other than publication dates... can you help?) transferred this species to its present genus. Synonyms of Tricholoma cingulatum include Tricholoma ramentaceum, Armillaria cingulata (Almfelt) Quél. and Agaricus cingulatus Almfelt ex Fr. Etymology The generic name Tricholoma means 'with hairs on the edge', which refers to the rim of the mushroom and is true of only a tiny minority of species (the knights) in the Tricholoma genus. The specific epithet cingulatum means 'with a girdle, belt or collar'. Identification guide Cap Convex at first, expanding with a slight umbo; pale grey or grey-brown, covered in fine grey-brown felty scales; initially roundish but often becoming irregular with a slightly wavy margin when mature; 3.5 to 6cm across. Gills White, emarginate; moderately spaced. Stem Whitish with a woolly or cottony ring; cylindrical; 5 to 8cm long, 8 to 12mm diameter. Spores Ellipsoidal, smooth, 5-6 x 2.5-3.5µm; inamyloid. Spore print White. Odour/taste Taste and smell slightly mealy. Habitat & Ecological role Mycorrhizal, nearly always found with willows; sometimes in dune slacks with Dwarf Willow. Season June to October in Britain and Ireland. Similar species Tricholoma sciodes is similar but does not have a stem ring. Culinary Notes Tricholoma cingulatum is recorded as edible in many field guides, but care is necessary to avoid confusion with any of the slightly poisonous greyish Tricholoma species that can cause stomach upsets. It is easy for beginners to confuse this species with deadly poisonous pallid mushrooms such as Amanita virosa, and so we cannot recommend the Girdled Knight as a culinary collectible for anyone but the most experienced and capable of fungi foragers.

      "common name": "Reference Sources Despite a visual similarity to the Sulphur Knight, this chunky mushroom is easily distinguished by its smell: it has none. Tricholoma equestre (syn. Tricholoma flavovirens) is also known as the Man on Horseback; why that should be is a mystery. Distribution Common in northern Scotland, under Scots Pine in sandy areas but also occasionally with birches and with oaks, this late season mushroom is rarely seen in southern Britain and in Ireland. Taxonomic history Carl Linnaeus described this striking mushroom in the second volume of his Species Plantarum of 1753, wherein he named it Agaricus equestris. (Most gilled fungi were in those days placed into a gigantic Agaricus genus, since made more manageable by redistributing most of its contents to other new genera.) It was the German mycologist Paul Kummer who, in 1871, transferred this species to the genus Tricholoma, thus creating its current binomial Tricholoma equestre. Synonyms of Tricholoma equestre include Agaricus equestre L., Agaricus auratus Paulet, Agaricus flavovirens Pers.,Tricholoma equestre var. equestre (L.) P. Kumm.,Tricholoma auratum (Paulet) Gillet, and Tricholoma flavovirens (Pers.) S. Lundell. Etymology Tricholoma was established as a genus by the great Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. The generic name comes from Greek words meaning 'hairy fringe', and it must be one of the least appropriate mycological genus names, because very few species within this genus have hairy or even shaggily scaly cap margins that would justify the descriptive term. As a specific epithet the term equestre is not quite so difficult to unscramble; it is to do with horse riding. Look at the mushrooms in the picture above and you will see that they have opened up to become saddle shaped... well, some of them do... a bit! Identification guide Cap Bright yellow, with a fibrous or scaly olive-brown central area; convex, often with a wavy margin and a slight central umbo; 5 to 9cm across. The flesh is white or very pale yellow. Gills Pale to right yellow; adnexed (often with a notch). Stem Pale yellow; lined vertically with brown fibres; cylindrical; 5 to 10cm long, 0.8 to 1.5cm diameter; no ring. Spores Ellipsoidal, smooth, 5-8.5 x 3-6µm, with a pronounmced hilar appendage; inamyloid. Spore print White. Odour/taste No significant odour. Tasting not advisable: several cases of severe poisoning have been confirmed as being the result of eating, over a period of several days, meals each containing moderate portions of these mushrooms. Habitat & Ecological role Mainly under pines, but also mycorrhizal with birches and occasionally oaks. Season July to October in Britain and Ireland; earlier in Scandinavia and rather later in southern Europe. Similar species Tricholoma sulphureum has a yellow cap without the brown-olive central area; it smells strongly of coal gas. Culinary Notes Although reported in some field guides to be edible and very tasty, and indeed having been sold as such throughout much of mainland Europe until recently, the Yellow Knight is now known to be toxic and should definitely not be collected for the pot. The poisonous chemicals in these fungi have not been definitely isolated, but several cases of painful muscle damage have been attributed to eating these chunky fungi.

      "common name": "Reference Sources Few tricholomas have truly descriptive common names, but the Soapy Knight, Tricholoma saponaceum has an odour of soap suds and thoroughly deserves the common name it has been given. That its soapy smell is so distinctive is a great help to fungus forayers, because the physical form and the colours of this woodland mushroom are very variable indeed. An easy agaric to spot in coniferous and broad-leaf forests, Tricholoma saponaceum appears in autumn, sometimes forming large groups (below). Distribution This woodland mushroom is fairly common and widespread throughout Britain and Ireland, and it occurs also in most parts of mainland Europe. Tricholoma saponaceum is also recorded in North America. Taxonomic history Although this mushroom was described scientifically by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, its basionym dates from 1818 when the great Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries gave it the name Agaricus saponaceus. (In those days most gilled mushrooms were included initially in the genus Agaricus; the vast majority of them have since been redistributed to many other genera.) Several varieties of the Soapy Knight are recognised, and the nominate form shown here is Tricholoma Saponaceum var. saponaceum. Synonyms of Tricholoma Saponaceum var. saponaceum include Agaricus atrovirens Pers., Agaricus saponaceus Fr., Agaricus napipes Krombh., Tricholoma saponaceum (Fr.) P. Kumm., Tricholoma saponaceum var. atrovirens (Pers.) P. Karst., and Tricholoma saponaceum var. napipes (Krombh.) Barla. Tricholoma Saponaceum var. squamosum (Cooke) Rea is a much rarer find in Britain and Ireland; it differs in having a very dark grey-brown cap (almost black in some instances) and dark scales also on the stem; but the soapy odour is just as obvious as in the nominate variety. (The specimens shown above might be Tricholoma saponaceum var. squamosum.) This variety of the Soapy Knight was described originally in 1884 by British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, who gave it the name Agaricus saponaceus var. squamosus. Etymology Tricholoma was established as a genus by the great Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries. The generic name comes from Greek words meaning 'hairy fringe', and it must be one of the least appropriate mycological genus names, because very few species within this genus have hairy or even shaggily scaly cap margins that would justify the descriptive term. The specific epithet saponaceum comes from Latin and is a reference to the soapy smell that is given off when the gills are crushed. Identification guide Also referred to as the Soap-scented Tricholoma, this is a woodland mushroom that quite often produces small tufted groups, as shown here. Cap Up to 12cm in diameter when fully mature, the very variable caps are usually greyish or greenish-grey in the centre but with a paler, often with an almost pure-white edge. Initially convex, the caps flatten, sometimes with a slight umbo, and the margins become wavy, sometimes flaring very irregularly. Gills Sinuate and well spaced apart, the gills are white but take on a reddish tinge a short time after being bruised. Stem Typically 10 to 20mm in diameter, the stem is white and covered with small light-grey fibres. This is a deep-rooting species. Spores Ellipsoidal, smooth, 5-7 x 3.5-4μm; inamyloid. Show larger image... Spores of Tricholoma saponaceum Spore print White. Odour/taste Strong odour of (naturally-scented!) soap when the gills are crushed or cut; taste is 'mushroomy'. (Note: this is an inedible and possibly poisonous species.) Habitat & Ecological role Ectomycorrhizal, in broadleaf and coniferous woodland. Season June to October in Britain and Ireland; rather later in soutern Europe.. Similar species Tricholoma terreum is sometimes pale capped and then it can be quite similar to Tricholoma saponaceum in appearance, but it does not have the distinctive soapy smell. Culinary Notes Unfortunately, not only is this abundant mushroom regarded as inedible but it may even be poisonous. In any case, who would want to eat soap?

Habitat & Ecological role Mycorrhizal, in broad-leaf woodland, mainly with Beech, limes and oaks;occasionally in pine woodland. Season Late June to early November in Britain and Ireland. Similar species Tricholoma sciodes is usually greyer in appearance, often with a violet tinge to its cap surface, and its gill edges develop black speckles; it occurs in oak woodland; its spores are much broader than those of Tricholoma scalpturatum. Culinary Notes Tricholoma scalpturatum is reported to be edible although rated no more than of moderate quality. Accurate identification is essential, however, as some members of this genus are poisonous, making it dangerous to include any but the most distinctive of of the 'knights' in mushroom dishes. Because Tricholoma species are notoriously variable in appearance, we do not include any of them in our own mushroom menus.

      "description": "Amanita fungi are not the only ones that have a volva at their stem base; mushrooms in the genus Volvariella do so as well. Volvariella surrecta is one of the rare members of this genus, and it has very particular habitat requirements. The Piggyback Rosegill grows on old and decaying fruitbodies of the Clouded Funnel, Clitocybe nebularis. (Very occasionally it hitches a ride of other kinds of mushrooms, but as it is a rare species the chances of seeing it anywhere but on a Clouded Funnel are extremely remote.)",
      "distribution": "The Piggyback Rosegill is a rare sight in Britain and Ireland, where it is most often reported from southern England. Volvariella surrecta has been recorded in many other European countries as well as in North Africa, parts of North America, and New Zealand.",
      "taxonomic history": "When English botanist John Leonard Knapp (1767 - 1845) described this remarkable mushroom in his 1829 Journal of a Naturalist, he referred to it as Agaricus surrectus and stated that it grew from the back of another mushroom which he called Agaricus casaeus - almost certainly the Clouded Funnel Clitocybe nebularis.",

      "taxonomic history": "When Swiss mycologist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described this mushroom in 1815 he called it Agaricus gloiocephalus. (Most gilled fungi were initially placed in a giant Agaricus genus, now redistributed to many other genera.) Until recently its generally-accepted scientific name dated from 1986, when mycologists Teun Boekhout and Manfred Enderle gave it the name Volvariella gloiocephala. Then, in a 2011 publication by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini and colleagues, the Stubble Rosegill acquired the new name Volvopluteus gloiocephalus.",
