  "Coltricia perennis": {
    "Edibility": "Inedible, leathery",
    "Common Name": "California Fungi, Tiger Eye",
    "Pileus": "Cap 1.0-7.0 cm broad, plano-depressed to funnel-form or umbilicate; margin straight to wavy, frequently deflexed at maturity; surface dull, matted-tomentose (use hand-lens), sometimes faintly wrinkled, with usually well-defined bands of cinnamon-brown, beige, yellowish-brown and greyish-tan, the actively growing margin lighter; specimens in exposed locations greyish with age; context pliant when fresh, rigid and hard when dry, medium-brown to rust-brown, 1.0-3.0 mm thick, blackish with 3% KOH; odor and taste untried.",
    "Habitat": "Solitary, gregarious, or clusters, usually associated with conifers, often growing in disturbed areas, e.g. roadsides, trails, moss-banks etc., rarely on rotting wood; also found early in the successional sequence after burns; occurring throughout the mushroom season in lowland forests, fall and spring in the Sierra Nevada; common but inconspicuous, easily overlooked.",
    "Comments": "The funnel-form caps of Coltricia perennis typically have well-defined bands of colors, these ranging from cinnamon-brown, yellow-brown to grey. Important identifying features are a tomentose cap surface and a usually decurrent tube layer. The closely related Coltricia cinnamomea has a faintly-zoned, reddish-brown fruiting body. The cap suface of Coltricia cinnamomea is covered with appressed fibrils rather than a tomentum. These fibrils sometimes give the species a shiny or glistening appearance. Look-alikes of Coltricia perennis include stipitate species of Polyporus, e.g. P. elegans, P. varius, etc. These can be told apart by their lignicolous habit and non rusty-brown context. Also similar are species of Hydnellum and Phellodon which have leathery, zonate caps, but are toothed, not pored. Finally, Ionotus tomentosus is another terrestrial, stipitate polypore, but it can be distinguished by a relatively thick, indistinctly-zoned cap and microscopically by the presence of setae.",
    "Distribution": "Uncommon and localised in areas of pine woods and plantations and on heathland in Britain and Ireland, Tiger's Eye occurs also in most parts of mainland Europe from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean region. Coltricia perennis is also commonly seen in conifer woodlands (especially pinewood plantations) in many parts of North America.\n\nThe beautifully zoned specimen below is shown by kind permission of Dustin Ware and Sarah Neumann, who took this photograph near Alpena, Michigan USA.",
    "Taxonomic history": "Tiger's Eye was described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who gave it the name Boletus perennis (at a time when any fungus with pores was placed initially into the genus Boletus). It was American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill (1869 - 1957) who, in 1903, transferred this species to the genus Coltricia, thus establishing its currently-accepted scientific name Coltricia perennis.",
    "Season": "Perennial, sporulating in the autumn.",
    "Similar species": "Trametes versicolor, Turkeytail, sometimes zoned produces rosettes but they grown from wood, are generally lobed and produce white spores."

  "Phaeophyscia orbicularis": {
    "Synonyms": "Physcia orbicularis, Phaeophyscia orbicularis var. hueana",
    "Description": "Thallus very variable in colour from pale grey to brown or almost black. Green when wet. Thalli are often circular, up to 3 cm in diameter but can be irregular. Long lobes about 1.5 mm wide divide near the tip looking like fingers. The lower surface is black with dark rhizines but these may protrude at the margins where they have white tips. White to greenish soralia, covered in a coarse powder, occur on the surface and occasionally at the margins.",
    "Distribution": "Throughout Britain and Ireland.",
    "Similar species": "Similar species: Hyperphyscia adglutinata has smaller (lobes to 0.5mm wide) and very closely adpressed to the substratum, only rarely on stone, Phaeophyscia adiastola: more commonly on rock but also epiphytic, soredia more granular, almost isidia-like and typically terminal and marginal rather than laminal.\nPhysciella melanchra: uniformly pale, longitudinally striate (prosoplectenchymatous) lower cortex (vs. paraplectenchymatous and dark at least centrally in P. orbicularis). To date we have not confirmed that P. melanchra occurs in our region",
    "Habitats": "Nutrient-enriched bark and twigs and basic stones especially on urban concrete.",
    "Season": "All year round",
    "Field characters": "Small, narrow-lobed, foliose chlorolichen. Thalli appressed, orbicular, attached throughout, to 3 cm diameter, sometimes forming large, confluent colonies. Lobes typically 0.5-1.5 mm across. Upper cortex grey-brown to dark brown, dull, lacking pruina, hairs, or isidia. Lower cortex black, but may be pale at the lobe tips or on some shaded thalli it may be almost entirely pale. The rhizines tend to be shorter and sparser than in other Phaeophyscia species, black with white tips, simple. Greenish to greyish granular to farinose soredia present in orbicular to irregular, laminal soralia, rarely also terminal or marginal. Medulla white. Apothecia common in urban sites, occasional elsewhere in Alberta. Often parasitized and then with lumpy, laminal darkened outgrowths.",
    "Ecology": "Epiphytic on a variety of host trees and shrubs, occasionally on rocks. Relatively common across all the boreal, foothills, parkland and grasslands, rare in the shield and mountain regions. Very common on urban boulevard trees (Haughland et al. 2022)"
